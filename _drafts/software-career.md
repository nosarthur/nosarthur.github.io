I read John Somez' first book on software developer's life manual when I landed 
in my first industry job and liked it (see [its book review here]({% post_url 2016-10-16-soft-skills %})).
Compared to that book, this one is more focused on career development.
It helps solve the problem of **if I don't know what I don't know, how do I proeed?**.

Basically, this book is about
how to get started as a software developer for a beginner,
how to advance career for mid-career developer,
and how to break the glass ceilings for experience professional.

The book is structured in the form of Q and A at chapter level.
And the chapters are categorized into five sections:

* Getting started as a software developer
* Getting a job
* What you need to know about software development
* Working as a developer
* Advancing your career
