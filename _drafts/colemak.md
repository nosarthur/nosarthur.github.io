Recently I ditched 20 years ot typing experience for a superior keyboard layout.
The baseline is the QWERTY layout.

name | year | number of key difference from QWERTY
--- | ---|---
QWERTY |~ 1878 | 0
Dvorak | 1936 | 33
Colemak | 2006 | 17
Workman ||
Carpalx ||


The general ideas of these alternative layouts include

- move the high frequency keys to more easily accessible locations, for
  example, move the vowels to the home row
- put bigrams on adjacent keys
