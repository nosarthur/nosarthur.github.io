For productivity, the author recommends the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
Although the word *pomodoro* sounds like Japanese, it is the Italian word for tomato and refers to the classic tomato-shaped timer. 
Basically, you time yourself on a task.
For every 25 min work, you get 5 min break (this 30 min is called a pomodoro).
If any interruption (answering phone call, checking emails, grabbing snacks, browsing webpages, etc) happens during the work section, it does not count as a pomodoro.
Then you get an idea of how many **focused** work sections (pomodoros) you can complete in a day.

The author also has a Youtube video to demonstrate how to use [kanbanflow](https://kanbanflow.com)
