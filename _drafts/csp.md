Molecular crystals have rich structural variations:
molecular conformation can vary, molecule packing can also vary.
They are called crystal polymorphs.

Polymorphism of molecular crystals is of great interest to many industries,
such as pharmaceutical, algricultural, energetic materials, pigments, etc.

such as efficacy and processability
