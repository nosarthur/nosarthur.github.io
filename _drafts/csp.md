In the past 5 years, I have been working on crystal structure prediction for molecular crystals.

Polymorphism of molecular crystals is of great interest to many industries,
such as pharmaceutical, algricultural, energetic materials, pigments, etc.
drugs (for human, animals, and plants)
dies,
high energy materials (dynamite)

downside: the market is not big. There are x new drugs each year.

Molecular crystals have rich structural variations:
molecular conformation can vary, molecule packing can also vary.
They are called crystal polymorphs.


such as efficacy and processability
