The author is a psychologist specialised in the 
psychology of compliance. This book grew out of his field study
of joining the compliance professional workforce (sales operators,
fund raisers, recruiters, advertisers, etc) 
as an under-covered researcher in a three year period.

He summarized six basic principles of all the tactics. 
Here is a brief summary of them.

* Reciprocation: when a small favor is given, even if it's uninvited, the feeling of obligation arises.
    * the reciprocity rule
    * the rejeciton-then-retreat technique
    * the contrast principle
* Consistency: after taking an initial stand, one has the luxury to stop thinking any more.
    * the foot-in-the-door technique
    * the 'throwing a lowball' trick
* Social proof: 
    * 'pluralistic ignorance'
    * 
* Authority:
* Liking:
* Scarcity:

There are many interesting examples in the book for these principles. 
Even better, the author provided strategies to defend oneself to 
each type of exploitations.
