Recently I was reading

and it occurs to me that
[Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution)
[binormial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution)
[Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
[Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)

or Markovianity.
