Vrscikasana

## beginning (Aug 2016)

My starting point:
* I am able to do head stand
* I can only do crow pose for 20 s 
* My head barely touches the floor in downward dog pose 
* I can only touch heels in camel pose

The limiting factors:
* flexibility 
    * upper arms only range -90 to 170 degrees with respect to spine
    * thighs only range 0 to 70 degrees with respect to spine
* strength
    * shoulder 

## step 1: head stand

## step 2: forearm stand

preliminaries Enough flexibility in the shoulder such that 

* forehead touches the floor in downward dog pose
* hands are right below the shoulders in wheel pose

## end
