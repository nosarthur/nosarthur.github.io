We recently bought a coop in New York city.

In retrospect,

- be proactive
- stop thinking of conspiracies

## follow the money

The seller is responsible for all the agent fees.
I read that the agent cost is typically 6% of the sale price, split among
all the agent parties.
There are 4 of them in total: seller's agent, seller's broker, buyer's agent,
and buyer's broker.
Here agents are the people you meet, and the brokers are companies they work for.

To be concrete, suppose the property sells for $500k. Then the seller needs to
pay $30k at closing.
For simplicity we can assume they split the commission evenly.
Then each party gets $7.5k.

I find it concerning that the buyer's agent is paid by the seller.

**Make the transaction happen, such that the agents and brokers earn the commission.**

There are 2 rarer situations.

|situation | pro | con |
|---|---|---|
| No buyer's agent | | |
| For sale by owner (FSBO) | | |

There is also the possibility that both the buyer's agent and seller's agent
work for the same broker.

According to the book [Buyers Are Liars & Sellers Are Too](https://amzn.to/30yf5Oc)
written by Richard Countney, FSBO is frowned upon.

## day -40: make the decision to buy

- location
- price range

When these two , the kind of proper is clear.

## day -40: get a buyer's agent

This is the part that I think I did wrong.

Attend open house, then pick buyer agent.

At open house, each potential buyer needs to sign in and the seller's agent will
ask if there is a buyer's agent.
The answer to this question determines whether the seller's team get all the commission.

## day -23: get mortgage pre-approval letter from a bank

Usually this should happen before getting the buyer's agent.

I got it in the same day.

## day -22: make offer

## day -21: offer gets accepted

no legal effect.

## day 0: fully executed contract

buyer one-sided

seller

## day 5: apply mortgage

It doesn't have to be the same bank that granted the pre-approval letter.

It is common to require within 45 days.

## day 9: appraisal approved

The appraisal is ordered by the bank.

The appraisal price is not disclosed to the seller.

## day 16: initiate 401k loan

## day 17: coop recognition agreement received

## day 21: loan commitment letter received

## day 39: board application submitted

## day 54: board interview
