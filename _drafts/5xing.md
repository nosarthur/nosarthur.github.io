Unlike the Indian system (and Greek system) with four basic elements (water, fire, earth, air), the Chinese system has five basic elements (tree, fire, earth, metal, water). Many consider aether as the fifth element but it is a bit difficult to reconcile aether with the other four concrete elements. To make correspondence between the Chinese system and the Indian system, I tend to think tree is a combination of air and water while metal is a combination of fire and earth. 

The five elements create and annihilate each other in a particular pattern. To make things more interesting, space, time, colors, sounds, tastes, human parts and even emotions can all be associated with the five elements. It is also a bit unsatisfactory from the perspective that six senses are available while smell and touch are not associated. It may be just that I do not know them.
