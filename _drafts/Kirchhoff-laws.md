[Kirchhoff's laws]() plays important roles in electric circuit analysis. 
They are easy to state, and directly relevant for algebraic calculations.
As a result, they are in the curriculum of middle schools or high schools.
In this post, I will show some connections of these circuit laws to cycle findings in graph theory.

The two Kirchhoff's laws are stated as

* **The current law**: At locations where electrical wires meet, the electrical currents sum to zero.
* **The voltage law**: The sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop is zero.
