## common strategies 

Divide and conquer (D&C) and dynamic programming (DP) are strategies
to solve complex coding problem by breaking it into sub-problems.

It helps to first think of recursion relation for the task.

### divide and conquer


### dynamic programming

It is a bottom-up approach. 

It is commonly used for string processing.

Every DP has a underlying directed acyclic graph (dag) structure, 
where the nodes are the sub-problems and the edges correspond to the 
recursion relation.

In DP, the sub-problems are usually only slightly smaller than the 
original problem, thus a recursive solution becomes too expensive
since the same sub-problems get solved over and over again.
