[MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) is a neat example of how physics and engineering can be put together to be extremely useful in biology.

There are mutiple Nobel prizes related to NMR

* [Isidor Isaac Rabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidor_Isaac_Rabi) was awarded the [1944 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his resonance method for recording the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei"](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1944/).
* [Richard R. Ernst]() was awarded the [1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry  "for his contributions to the development of the methodology of high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy"](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1991/).
* [Sir Peter Mansfield]() and [Paul C. Lauterbur]() were awarded the [2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their "discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging"](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2003/).
