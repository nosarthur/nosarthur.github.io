The readings of Radiologists are typically

* time consuming 
* tedious
* expensive

Thus automation using deep learning may be the future.

## what has been done

* Automated lymph node detection from CT images. 
	* For the two datasets 
of 90 CT volumes with 388 mediastinal LNs and 86 patients with 595 abdominal LNs,
sensitivity of 70%/83% at 3 FP/vol and 84%/90% at 6 FP/vol is achieved.
	* axial, coronal and sagittal slices in a Volume-of-Interest (VOI) into to the RGB channels
	* represent 3D image volume by a set of 2D image set with 3 orthogonal slices

* pancreas segmentation in CT imaging
	* 60 training, 2 validation, 20 testing
	* Dice scores of 68% Â± 10% (range, 43-80%) in testing

* patch-based 3D hippocampal segmentation 

* automated classification of human anatomy 
	1. Classify axial CT images into six anatomical classes: brain, neck,
 shoulder, chest, abdomen, pelvis.
200 training set gives rise to over 95% accuracy on 6000 test cases.
	2. using 4,298 separate axial 2D key-images to learn 5 anatomical classes: neck, lung, liver, pelvis, legs, with AUC 0.998 and classification error 5.9%
