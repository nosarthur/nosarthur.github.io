## Introduction 

[Bodhidharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma) is the Indian Buddhist monk who brought Zen Buddhism to China around 475 AD.
Before him, Buddhism had already been introduced to China and had already been somewhat popular.
Documents show the existence of Buddhist community in China as early as 
65 AD (Gautama the Buddha lived around 500 BC). 
In China, at least in popular culture, it is believed that all martial art forms originate from 
the [Shaolin Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Monastery) and specifically to Bodhidharma.

Nowadays [Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) becomes a buzzword with many different meanings.
I don't know what it means exactly. I also don't know why the Zen school instead of the many other Buddhism schools flourished in East Asian countries (mainly China, Japan and Korea).
Here are some pieces of information that may of some interest

* Zen may mean 'meditation'. 

    Zen is the Japanese spelling of the Chinese word Chan, which may be the Sanskrit word dhyana. Dhyana could either mean concentration or stages of meditation experiences. In Buddhism teaching, depending on which school it is, there may be 8 or 9 different dhyana stages.

* The Zen school may be an 'advanced' school.

    There are many stories about monks in the Zen school reaching enlightenment suddenly. It may all sound good but one should note that these monks might be the ones close to enlightenment in the first place.
Seeking enlightenment in short time span or even bothering to seek enlightenment may not be wise.

* [Koan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K≈çan) is used as a practice technique.

    Koan study is somewhat unique to the Zen school. Koan refers to some 'illogical' statements or conversations that helped former Zen masters to reach enlightenment. The amateur monk is supposed to focus/meditate on the koan and hopefully figures out what it is about. Several meditation teachers have told me that 'thinking' is an advanced meditation technique suitable for more advanced practitioners and it is safer to use body instead of mind as the meditation tool for beginners, e.g., breathing, bodily sensations. Thus koan study may be an advanced practice.

The author [Red Pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pine_(author)) is
an American author and Buddhist who translated many Buddhism and Taoism books into English.
This book contains four works by Bodhidharma

* Outline of Practice
* Bloodstream Sermon
* Wake-up Sermon
* Breakthrough Sermon

Both the original Chinese text and English translations are included.

I am far from understanding the texts. 
What I write in this post may be totally wrong and unorthodox. 

## Outline of Practice

This sermon is less than 3 pages. It points out that there are essentially two ways to the Path

* By reason
* By practice
    * suffering injustice 
    * adapting to conditions
    * seeking nothing
    * practicing the Dharma

The first way is more internal which requires understanding and some belief
whereas the second way is more external and practical. 

I think that the essence of the teaching is 

* all living things share the same true nature

and the practice is acceptance. 

## Bloodstream Sermon

* A Buddha isn't a Buddha.
* "All appearances are illusions."
* "That which is free of all form is the Buddha."
* Seeing your own nature is Zen.
