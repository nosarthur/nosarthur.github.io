## Introduction 

[Bodhidharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma) is the Indian Buddhist monk who brought Zen Buddhism to China around 475 AD.
Before him, Buddhism had already been introduced to China and had already been somewhat popular.
Documents show the existence of Buddhist community in China as early as 
65 AD (the founder of Buddhism Gautama the Buddha lived around 500 BC). 
In China, at least in popular culture, it is also believed that all martial art forms originate from the [Shaolin Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Monastery) and trace back to Bodhidharma.

Nowadays [Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) is a buzzword with many different meanings.
I don't know what it means exactly. I also don't know why the Zen school instead of the many other Buddhism schools flourished in East Asian countries (mainly China, Japan and Korea).
Here are some pieces of information that I picked up from here and there that may of some interest

* Zen may mean 'meditation'. 

    Zen is the Japanese spelling of the Chinese word Chan, which may be the Sanskrit word dhyana. Dhyana could either mean concentration or stages of meditation experiences. In Buddhism teaching, depending on which school it is, there may be 8 or 9 different dhyana stages.

* The Zen school may be an 'advanced' school.

    There are many stories about monks in the Zen school reaching enlightenment suddenly. It may all sound good but one should note that these monks might be the ones close to enlightenment in the first place.
Seeking enlightenment in short time span or even bothering to seek enlightenment may not be wise.

* [Koan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K≈çan) is used as a practice technique.

    Koan study is somewhat unique to the Zen school. Koan refers to some 'illogical' statements or conversations that helped former Zen masters to reach enlightenment. The amateur monk is supposed to focus/meditate on the koan and hopefully figure out what it is about. Several meditation teachers have told me that 'thinking' is an advanced meditation technique suitable for more advanced practitioners and it is safer to use body instead of mind as the meditation object for beginners, e.g., breathing, bodily sensations. Thus koan study may also be an advanced practice.

The author [Red Pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pine_(author)) is
an American author and Buddhist who translated many Buddhism and Taoism books into English.
This book contains four works by Bodhidharma

* Outline of Practice
* Bloodstream Sermon
* Wake-up Sermon
* Breakthrough Sermon

Both the original Chinese text and English translations are included.

In this post, I will give brief summary of the content, based on my preliminary understandings.

## Outline of Practice

There are essentially two ways to the Path

* By reason
* By practice
    * suffering injustice 
    * adapting to conditions
    * seeking nothing
    * practicing the Dharma

The first way is more internal which requires understanding and some belief
whereas the second way is more external and practical. 

I think that the essence of the teaching is 'non-self' and the practice is acceptance. There is a difference between acceptance and suppression: 
desires need to be recognized and accepted as part of self. If desires are not fulfilled, a large part of the energy will be wasted to work against yourself.

## Bloodstream Sermon

* A Buddha isn't a Buddha.
* "All appearances are illusions."
* "That which is free of all form is the Buddha."
* Seeing your own nature is Zen.

## Wake-up Sermon

## Breakthrough Sermon
