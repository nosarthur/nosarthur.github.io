## Introduction 

[Bodhidharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma) is the Indian Buddhist monk who brought Zen Buddhism to China around 475 AD.
Before him, Buddhism had already been introduced to China and had already been somewhat popular.
Documents show the existence of Buddhist community in China as early as 
65 AD (Gautama the Buddha lived around 500 BC). 

In China, Bodhidharma is also considered as an important figure in martial art and qigong practice.
There is a saying that all martial art forms originate from the [Shaolin Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Monastery) and it was Bodhidharma who 
started teaching the Chinese monks exteranl forms of yoga which evolved into 
martial arts. Legend says he left two books on yoga/qigong practice,
one of which survies to today: [Yijing Jing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yijin_Jing).

I should also point out that qigong and meditation were not introduced to China
By Bodhidharma. They have already been popular for quite some time
in the Taoism and Confucian traditions (for example, the Taoism teacher 
[Laozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) lived around 600 BC).

Nowadays [Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) becomes a buzzword.
I don't know what it means exactly. I also don't know why the Zen school instead of the many other Buddhism schools flourished in East Asian countries (China, Japan and Korea).
Here are some pieces of information that I know

* Zen may simply mean 'meditation'. 

    Zen is the Japanese spelling of the Chinese word Chan, which may be the Sanskrit word [dhyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhy%C4%81na_in_Buddhism). Dhyana could either mean concentration or stages of meditation experiences. In Buddhism, depending on which school it is, there may be 8 or 9 different dhyana stages.

* The Zen school may be an 'advanced' school.

    There are many [Buddhism schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_Buddhism). In China the most popular ones may be the Zen school and the Pure Land school. There are many historical stories about Zen monks reaching enlightenment suddenly. It may all sound good but one should note that these monks might be the ones close to enlightenment in the first place.
Seeking enlightenment may not be wise.

* [Koan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K≈çan) is used as a practice technique.

    Koan study is somewhat unique to the Zen school. Koan refers to some 'illogical' statements or conversations that helped former Zen masters to reach enlightenment (or test whether the disciple has understood the Path). The amateur monk is supposed to focus/meditate on the koan and hopefully figures out what it is about. Several meditation teachers have told me that 'thinking' is an advanced meditation technique suitable for more advanced practitioners and it is safer to use body instead of mind as the meditation tool for beginners, e.g., breathing, bodily sensations. Thus koan study may be an advanced practice.

The author [Red Pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pine_(author)) is
an American writer and Buddhist who translated many Buddhism and Taoism books into English.
This book contains four works by Bodhidharma

* Outline of Practice
* Bloodstream Sermon
* Wake-up Sermon
* Breakthrough Sermon

Both the original Chinese text and English translations are included. They are placed side by side (Chinese on the left and English on the right), and the author made sure that the two texts flow with the same pace.

I am far from understanding the texts. 
What I write in this post may be totally wrong and unorthodox. 

## Outline of Practice

This sermon is less than 3 pages. It points out that there are essentially two ways to the Path

* By reason
* By practice
    * suffering injustice 
    * adapting to conditions
    * seeking nothing
    * practicing the Dharma

The first way requires understanding and some belief
whereas the second way requires practice. 

It is pointed out that the understanding is

> all living things share the same true nature

## Bloodstream Sermon

Before going into the sermon, I would like to explain the word 'buddha'.
It is the Sanskrit for awareness, and it usually refers to 

* someone who has realized the Path. In the Wake up Sermon, Bodhidharma gave an definition: mortals whose minds minds are aware reach the Way of Enlightenment and are therefore called buddhas.
* [Gautama the Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha), who is theIndian prince who created Buddhism 

In this sermon, there are a few important points

* This mind is the buddha.
* Trying to find a buddha or enlightenment is like trying to grab space.
* To find a buddha, you have to see your nature. Whoever sees his nature is a buddha.
* If you don't understand by yourself, you'll have to find a teacher to get to the bottom of life and death.
* Once attached to appearances or forms, you are unaware.
* To go from mortal to buddha, you have to put an end to karma, nurture your awareness, and accept what life brings.

## Wake-up Sermon

* The essence of the Way is detachment and the goal of those who practice is free from appearances.
* To transcend motion and stillness is the highest meditation.
