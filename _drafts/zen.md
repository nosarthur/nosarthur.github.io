[Bodhidharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma) is the Indian Buddhist monk who brought Zen Buddhism to China around 475 AD.
Before him, Buddhism had already been introduced to China and might already been somewhat popular.
Documents shows the existence of Buddhist community in China 
as early as 65 AD (the founder of Buddhism Gautama the Buddha lived around 500 BC). 
In China, at least in popular culture, it is believed that all martial art forms originate from the [Shaolin Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Monastery) and trace back to Bodhidharma.

Nowadays [Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) is a buzzword with many different meanings.
I don't know what it means exactly. I also don't know why the Zen school flourished in East Asian countries (mainly China, Japan and Korea).
Here are some pieces of information that I picked up from here and there

* Zen may mean 'meditation'. 

    Zen is the Japanese spelling of the Chinese word Chan, which may be the Sanskrit word dhyana. Dhyana could either mean concentration or stages of meditation. In Buddhism teaching, depending on which school it is, there may be 8 or 9 different dhyana stages.

* The Zen school may be an 'advanced' school.

    There are many stories about monks in the Zen school reaching enlightenment suddenly. It may all sound good but one should note that these monks might be the ones close to enlightenment in the first place.
* [Koan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K≈çan) is used as a practice technique.

    Koan study is somewhat unique to the Zen school. Koan refers to some 'illogical' statements or conversations that helped former Zen masters to reach enlightenment. 

This book contains the original Chinese text and English translations.
