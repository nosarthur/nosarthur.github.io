I am in a unique position to write a book for non-physicists who are interested
in quantum computing.

* I have involved in various quantum computing projects including state preparation,
  gate design, decoherence, entanglement quantification, quantum algorithm design.
* In my current job, I do not have the presure to apply funding or catch any deadline for publish.

Back in May 2018, I read several books on book writing

the advantages of online book include

* easier to stay up to date
* easier to be accessed
* interact with readers
