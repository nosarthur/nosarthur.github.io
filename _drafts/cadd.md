Free energy perturbation

## theory

$$ K_a = \frac{\text{host:guest}}{[\text{host}][\text{guest}]} $$

The standard binding free energy

$$\Delta A_\text{binding}^0=-\frac{1}{\beta}\log(c^0K_a) $$

### Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) method

## single-topology paradigm and double-topology paradigm

## toy model

* creation and annihilation
* point mutation
* navigation along a geometrical reaction coordinate
