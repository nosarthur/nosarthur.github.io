I heard of this book from some online forum. Someone said that this book helped him with his retirement finance with his meager postdoc salary.
Since I was earning meager postdoc salary in one of the most expensive cities at the time, I got a copy.

This is a great book with a lot of information. It is very fun to read and I highly recommend it.

The author delivers a clear message as early as in the prologue:

* if you wanna hire someone to manage your money in stock market, you may as well hire a monkey.



* fundermental analysis
* technical analysis
* modern portfolio theory
