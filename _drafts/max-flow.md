each edge

* capacity
* flow: 

flow can be defined between any two nodes
does not require edge

Kirchhoff's current law  applies to the nodes

conservation law
Whatever leaves the source enters the target.

It is obvious that any cut >= any flow.
Further more min cut >= max flow.

breath first augmenting path

worst case $$O(VE^2)$$ augmentation

pathological cases if depth first path finding is used
