There are two things in quantum mechanics that I always find weird:

* the superposition principle
* the measurement of von Neumann type

There are famous paradoxes for the superposition principle

* the Schrodinger's cat
* the Einstein-P-R (EPR) paradox

hidden variable interpretation, parallel universe interpretation of quantum mechanics

Let $$p(HT)$$ denote the probability of the outcome being one head (H) and one tail (T).

$$
p(HT) = p_1(H)p_2(T) + p_1(T)p_2(H)
$$

one of the Bell state

$$
\left|\psi\right> = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\left(\left|HT\right> + \left|TH\right>\right) 
$$

For this state, 
$$
p_1(H)= p_2(T) = p_1(T)= p_2(H)= \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$p(HT)=1$$

Bell's inequality
