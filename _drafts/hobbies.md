I enjoy many hobbies. Over the years, however, many faded away.
Here I will analyze why they faded.

For some unknown reason, my hobbies are mostly physical.
Intellectual games such as bridge and poker somehow does not interest me very much.
The only two non-physical hobbies are 

* reading books 
* watching Youtube videos.


* autonomous
* sustainable

Autonomous mean

* yoga
* martial art
    1. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 
    2. Kendo
    3. Karate
* rock climbing
* tennis
* wind surfing
* running
