[Polya enumeration theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_enumeration_theorem) is a powerful tool in combinatorics. The paradigm 
question it answers is

* What are the distinct necklaces one can make using N black and M white beads?

If one is only interested in the number of distinct necklaces,
a weak version of it called [Burnsideâ€™s Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma) can be used.

For example, suppose N=2 and M=1.



On a more abstract level, Polya enumeration theorem solves the following problem: given a set S (beads), some equivalence criteria, 


stabilizer

counting orbits


$$(x+y)^2 = x^2 + xy + yx + y^2$$
