## introduction

[Polya enumeration theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_enumeration_theorem) is a very powerful tool in combinatorics. The paradigm 
question it answers is:
**How many distinct necklaces can one make out of N black and M white beads?**

For example, suppose N=2 and M=2.
It's easy to see that there are only two possibilities, as shown in Figure 1.
When the number of beads gets large, it will be very tedious to enumerate them by brutal force.
And this post is all about neat book keeping tricks.

Before we proceed to the tricks, I would like to point out a few random things.
The mathematician [George Polya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya) who discovered this enumeration theorem
has various important contributions to combinatorics, number theory, and probability theory.
One interesting and popular example is the [Polya urn model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_urn_model), commonly known as 'the rich get richer'. 
He also wrote a popular book on problem solving called [How to solve it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It).
Also he lived up to 97 years of age.

## preliminary attempts

There are two complications in our necklace counting problem:

* identical beads
* symmetry caused by the necklace

The former is quite easy to deal with.
In fact, if we ignore the necklace symmetry for now, elementary combinatorics would tell us that there are 

$$ \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 $$

ways to arrange the 2 black and 2 white beads. They are listed in Figure 2.
From now on I will draw the necklaces as squares because for four beads the symmetry group is 
[dihedral group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group) of order 4, i.e., $$D_4$$.

> Figure 2. Six different ways to arrange 2 black and 2 white beads without considering $$D_4$$ symmetry.
The first and second rows are two different orbits.

There are 8 elements in $$D_4$$

$$D_4 = \{R_0, R_{90}, R_{180}, R_{270}, H, V, D_1, D_2 \}$$

where $$R_\theta$$ is rotation with $$\theta$$ degrees (say clockwise), $$H$$ and $$V$$ are horizontal and vertical flips,
$$D_{1,2}$$ are diagonal flips. Specifically, let's assume $$D_1$$ flips around the line connecting the two white balls in the first necklace in the second row.
Note also that $$R_0$$ is identity.

From Figure 2, we can see that the 4 necklaces in the first row are equivalent
to each other under the symmetry of $$D_4$$ and the 2 necklaces in the second row are equivalent.
Thus there are only two distinct necklaces with the given beads.
These equivalent necklaces are examples of [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action#Orbits_and_stabilizers) in group theory.

As a summary, what we did in this section is to first explore the identical bead condition to limit the $$4!=24$$ possible necklaces to 6.
Then check their equivalence by hand.
This approach is not practical when the number of beads gets large.

## the magic

To demonstrate the power of Polya enumerate theorem, let me first show you the procedure to get that answer of 2 for our necklace counting problem.

Each group is associated with a polynomial called [cycle index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_index),
which is basically a fingerprint of the group in terms of how its individual element generates cycles (more details will be given in the next section).
The cycle index of many famous groups are known. Even if it is unknown for a group, its calculation is very easy albeit somewhat tedious.
For $$D_4$$ it is given by 

$$Z_{D_4}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = \frac{z_1^4 + 2z_1^2z_2 + 3z_2^2 + 2z_4}{8} $$

Now we make the substitution 

$$z_1\rightarrow B+W, z_2\rightarrow B^2+W^2, z_4\rightarrow B^4 + W^4$$

where $$B$$ and $$W$$ denote the color of the bead. After simplification, the polynomial becomes

$$B^4 + B^3W + 2B^2W^2 + BW^3 + W^4$$

and the coefficient of $$B^2W^2$$, i.e., 2, is the number of distinct necklaces with 2 black beads and 2 white beads.
Similarly, the coefficients of other terms are the number of distinct necklaces with the corresponding beads.
Also, if we set $$B=W=1$$, then the polynomial evaluates to $$6$$, which is the number of distinct necklaces with four beads of two colors.
Furthermore, if we set $$z_1=z_2=z_4=n$$, then the polynomial evaluates to the number of distinct necklaces with four beads of $$n$$ colors.

I was quite shocked when I first learned this.

## the details

In this section, I will try to explain why the previous magic works. Basic familarity with group theory is assumed.
For example, you should know what [coset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset) is.

The following three concepts are essential for Polya enumeration theorem:

* orbit
* stabilizer
* fixed points

With these terminology, our necklace counting problem can be stated as:
**given a group G (symmetry, equivalence criterion) acting on a set X (beads), how many different orbits (necklaces) are there?**

orbits partition the set

Weighted version of [Burnsideâ€™s Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma) can be used.


$$(x+y)^2 = x^2 + xy + yx + y^2$$
