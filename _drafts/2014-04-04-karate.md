*Disclaimer: Sugiyama sensei is my teacher's teacher and I have 
been to many seminars of this school.*

The author, [Sugiyama sensei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shojiro_Sugiyama) is a well-respected karate instructor who came to USA in the 
sixties. 

There are three types of karate books. 
The first type talks about the history of karate, 
shows pictures of the basic moves, and a few kata. 
Most books belong to this type.
The second type further talks about breathing, coordination of the body in the basic moves.
