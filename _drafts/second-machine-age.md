## ideas


information
* non-rival
* cheap to copy 

* winner-take-all economy

1. The big stories
    * The [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution)
      in late eighteenth century, particularly the
      steam engines, allows us to overcome the limitations of
      muscle power. The computer technologies nowadays are doing the same thing
      for mental power.
1. The skills of the new machines
    * Computers are good at following rules, but lousy at pattern recognition.
    * The 3 key characteristics of technological progress in the era of digital
      hardware, software, and networks are: exponential, digital, and combinatorial.
1. Moore's law and the second half of the chessboard
1. The digitization of Just about everything
    * The unique economic properties of digital information: such information is
      non-rival, and it hasclose to zero marginal cost of reproduction.
    * Information is costly to produce but cheap to reproduce.
    * Six of the ten most popular content sites throughout the world are primarily
      user-generated, as are six of the top ten in the United States.
1. Innovation: declining or recombining?
    * The three novelties of [Second Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution):
      electricity, the internal combustion engine, and inndoor plumbing with
      running water, all of which came onto the scene between 1870 and 1900.
1. Artificial and human intelligence in the second machine age
1. Computing bounty
1. Beyond GDP
1. The spread
10. The biggest winners: stars and superstars
1. Implications of the bounty and the spread
1. Learning to race with machines: recommendations for individuals
    * ideation
    * large-frame pattern recognition
    * highly complex communication
1. Policy recommendations
    * When technology advances too quickly for education to keep up, inequality
      generally rises.
1. Long-term recommendations
1. Technology and the Future
