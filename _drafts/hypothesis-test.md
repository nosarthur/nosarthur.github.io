Professor Allen Downey wrote some very nice blog posts to summarize the 
essence of hypothesis test. 

* Null hypothesis H0: 

For example, a common scenario for hypothesis test is to decide whether two groups are the same.

* test statistic

merge the group and resampling test or permution test

$$P(E|H0)$$

mean difference

$$\chi^2$$ proportional difference

the chance of getting a high $$\chi^2$$ decreases as the sample size increases

p-value

## t-test

accounts for sample size

multivariable regression, feature selection

## $$\chi^2$$-test
