Professor Allen Downey wrote some very nice blog posts to summarize the 
essence of hypothesis test. 

## axioms of probability

1. $$0\le P(A)\le 1 for \forall A$$
1. $$P(\text{all})=1$$, $$P(\emptyset)=0$$
1. $$P(A)+P(B)-P(A,B) = P(A\lor B)$$

* Null hypothesis H0: 

For example, a common scenario for hypothesis test is to decide whether two groups are the same.

* test statistic

merge the group and resampling test or permution test

$$P(E|H0)$$

mean difference

$$\chi^2$$ proportional difference

the chance of getting a high $$\chi^2$$ decreases as the sample size increases

p-value

## basic statistics

If the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is known, then sample can be generated by picking a random number from 0 to 1 and find the value that matches the random number.

* `numpy.random.random()` or `random.random()`: generate uniform random number from 0 to 1
* `numpy.random.choice()`: sample with or without replacement from a sequence
* `random.sample()`: sample without replacement

## t-test

accounts for sample size

multivariable regression, feature selection

## $$\chi^2$$-test
