## introduction

maximum common subgraph (MCS)

* maximum common induced subgraph (MCIS)
* maximum common edge subgraph (MCES)

MCS is in the NP-complete class.

## strategies

maximum clique 

a MCIS between two graphs is equivalent to a maximum clique in the modular product graph.

maximum clique  is also in the NP-complete class.

## algorithms

There is a comprehensive review of existing algorithms
