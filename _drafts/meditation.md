There are two steps for meditation

- Stop
- Meditate

The first step common method is to focus one's attention on one thing, which
could be

- a specific point in the body, for example, between the eye brows, tip of nose,
  center of chest, etc
- an object outside of body, for example, a candle light
- a thought
- a mantra
- a mental image
