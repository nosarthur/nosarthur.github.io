I started climbing in graduate school. Most of the time I visit indoor climbing gyms.
Outdoor is much more intense and usually takes days, which I don't like.

There are essentially two types of climbing: with and without rope.

* with rope
    * top roping
    * leading
* without rope
    * bouldering

Top roping means you are attached to a rope above you so that when you fall, you don't fall much.
Leading means the rope is beneath you and you need to clip it on to the pre-set carabiners on the wall (or rock) as you climb.
Thus if you fall, you fall twice the distance from where you are to where the last carabiner is.
Indoor climbing gyms provide all three types of climbings.
You need to go throught some simple safety training for top-roping and some serious body conditioning for leading.

Personally, I don't like being tied to a rope thus I almost only do bouldering.
Since there is no rope, bouldering problems are usually only 3-5 meters high. There are some risks falling from a bouldering problem.
Bad landing may result in broken ankle.
It is better to have control and not let ego take over.

The bouldering problems are usually much more interesting than top roping ones. The routes are designed to test specific climbing techniques.
On the other hand, the top roping and leading routes usually require a lot more stamina instead of skills.

The best climbing book I read is
