For some reason, the second law of thermodynamics is commonly known as "entropy does not decrease".
In my opinion, it is a bad way to understand what's going on because entropy is a somewhat abstract concept and it's not immediately clear why it tends to increase even if we equate entropy to complexity. 

On the other hand, the earlier formulations of the second law have very clean physical meanings: perpetual machine (of the second kind) is not possible.

I don't know why this clean formulation gives way to the entropy formulation. In this post, I will explain how this clean way works.

## entropy

## second law in terms of extracting work
