The author [Joseph Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell) had a very interesting life trajectory. 
In his early ages, he was fascinated by the American Indian fairy tales and later decided to study humanity for his college and graduate education. 
While in college, he was among the fastest half-mile runners in the world.
After a trip to Europe as part of his doctoral fellowship from Columbia University, he withdrew from the PhD program and 
lived in a shack in the woods for five years doing independent study. 
The living cost of this hermit period came from his earlier earnings as a Rock band member. 
At the end of this hermit period, he accepted a professor offer at Sarah Lawrence College and worked there 38 years till his retirement.
He married one of his student and had no children. He passed away at the age of 83.

There are interview clips of him on Youtube and you can see that he is a very intense person. 

This book is his first book and also arguably the most famous one. 


The author holds that mythologies are disguised truths.

In this book, Professor Campbell presented his view that 

all myths, fairy tales and religious stories are essentially the same, which he calls the mono-myth.


For example, George Lucas stated that the story of Star Wars was influenced by Joseph Campbell's work on mono-myth.
