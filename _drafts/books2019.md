Here is a list of the books I read in 2019. The recommended ones are in bold.

## life

- **Life and Death in Shanghai by Nien Cheng**:
- As a Man Thinketh by James Allen:

## career

- How to Be a Programmer by Robert L. Read:
- The manager's path by Camille Fournier: a great guide if you are interested in climbing career ladder
  in a tech company
- **How to change the world by Bornstein**:  Ashoka foundation

## finance

- Rich dad poor dad by : It's a nice introduction to personal finance.

## technology

- **The Go Programming Language by Alan A. A. Donovan**: This is the Golang
  bible written by the creators of the language.
- Software architecture with golang by : This book glimps at many useful topics
  not in details.

## others

- **How to change your mind by Michael Pollan**: This is a very interesting book
  about the history, the community, the scientific research, and the author's
  own experience with psychedelics. These drugs seem to temporarily eliminate
  ego and provide a glimpse of a non-self experience.
- **天才在左，疯子在右**: Its title can be translated as "Genius on the left,
  madness on the right". It is a compilation of interviews of mental patients.
  Many of them have tremendous concentration, determination, and logic power to
  think about
