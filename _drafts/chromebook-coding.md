**TL;DR** To use the chromebook productively as a programmer

* enable developer mode
* install [chromebrew](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew)
* stay on the stable channel

in chronicle order

* ssh to gcloud to do coding
* 


Redhat, Fedora, 

The channel

Settings -> About Chrome OS -> Detailed build information

* Stable
* Beta
* Developer - unstable

There is an even more **Canary** channel. Type the following command in crosh:

```
live_in_a_coal_mine
```

chromebrew only supports stable channel

vs code has

## complaints

* With developer mode, `ctrl+d` to proceed with the boot process.
* There is no way to show date on the task bar, only time.
