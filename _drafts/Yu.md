This post is to pay tribute to my friend Yu Chen who left us in a tragic incident on Lake Mendota around 5:45PM on May 31, 2017.

Yu is one of the few people I know who excel in everything they do. As far as I know, he is 

* a researcher who received Ph.D from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and conducted postdoc work there with the focus on [radiation oncology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy)
* an engineer who develops radiation oncology products to benefit the society
* a windsurfer who devotes his time teaching windsurfing as a voluntary instructor at [Hoofer Sailing club](http://www.hoofersailing.org)
* a runner who finishes full Marathon in 3.5 hours
* a singer whose songs are played by his coworker while driving
* a body builder 
* a skier and snowboarder
* a skater
* a regular blood donor

I first met Yu from a mutual friend, and really got to know him from wind surfing. 

* passionate
* talented, both intellectually and physically
* persistent
* compasionate

Yu loves wind surfing. Whenever he met new friends, he would introduce this sport to them and describe in detail how cool it is. We used to joke that [Hoofer sailing club](http://www.hoofersailing.org) should pay commision to him as many people joined the club because of his advertisement, including me. Back in the summer of 2011, we would meet almost everyday on [lake mendota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mendota). Even on windless days, we would checkout shortboards for [standup paddling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standup_paddleboarding) to train body balance.
