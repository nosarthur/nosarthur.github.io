This post is to pay tribute to my friend Yu Chen who lost his life in a tragic incident on Lake Mendota around 5:45PM on May 31, 2017.

Yu is one of the few people I know who excel in everything they do. As far as I know, he is 

* a researcher who received Ph.D from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and conducted postdoc work there with the focus on [radiation oncology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy)
* an engineer who develops radiation oncology products
* a windsurfer who devoted his time teaching windsurfing as a voluntary instructor at [Hoofer Sailing club](http://www.hoofersailing.org)
* a runner with Marathon
* a singer whose coworker plays his songs in car
* a body builder 
* a skiier and snowboarder
* a skater
