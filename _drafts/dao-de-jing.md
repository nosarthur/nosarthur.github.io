[Dao de jing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching) is the [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism) canon written by its founder [Laozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) (about 600BC ~ 500 BC).
Legend says that one day a Chinese boarder official observed purple sign in the sky and he knew some important person must be coming soon.
It was Laozi leaving China to the West riding on an ox.
The official begged Laozi to write some text before he left and Laozi wrote Dao de jing.
Part of this story is recorded in [Records of the Grand Historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Grand_Historian), an important Chinese history book finished around 94 BC.

There are three versions available nowadays

* The commonly distributed version (about 5000 characters)
* The [Mawangdui ()](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawangdui) version (discovered in 1973 in a tomb, written on silk, dated around 190 BC, about 1000 characters)
* The Guodian () version (discovered in 1993 in a tomb, written on bamboo tablets, dated prior to 300 BC, about 1000 characters)

The commonly distributed version of Dao de jing is divided into two parts,
the Dao (this character could mean path, spiritual practice, etc),
and the De (this character could mean virtue, it could also mean gain), totaling 81 paragraphs.
You can find translation of the full text from [the Chinese Text Project](http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing).

In early 1970s, two antient copies of Dao de jing were discovered in a tomb dated back to the [Han dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty) (206 BC ~ 9 AD) called [Mawangdui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawangdui).
They are called copy A and copy B.
Interestingly, there are some small discrepancies between copy A and B.
And the discrepancy with repect to the commonly distributed version is even greater.
In this Mawandui version, De comes before Dao.
You can see these two copies [from this link](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/老子_(帛書本))

In 1993, three more antient copies of Dao de jing were discovered in [another antient tomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guodian_Chu_Slips). These copies dates back to at least 300 BC.
Let's call them copy 1, 2, and 3.
Their differences to the commonly distributed version is quite big.
You can see these three copies from [the Chinese Text Project](http://ctext.org/guodian/zhs).

Here I will give an translation of the copy 1 of Guodian version.
