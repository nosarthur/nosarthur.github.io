There is no introduction needed for [Steven King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King) and this book ranks number 6 in [Time magazine's all time 100 best non-fiction books since 1923 (the year Time magazine began)](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/12719.Time_Magazine_s_All_TIME_100_Best_Non_Fiction_Books).

In the foreword, Steven King highly recommended [The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style),
and he also commented that

> This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit.

Soon it becomes obvious that this book bears no resemblance to The Elements of Style:
it is fun to read and has little help to writing skills.


* avoid passive tense
* The adverb is not your friend.

He also made an observation that "fear is at the root of most bad writings".

and his ultimate advice is to read a lot and write a lot.
