## pre-processing

In this data set, there are 1679 unique sentences, 178 unique
words and 118 unique root words. 

There are 23 words that only appeared once, and 12 words that 
only appear twice in the data set, as seen in Table 1. 
For these 23 words, 11 of them show up only once as one-word sentences.
We thus remove them and arrive at a dictionary with 167 words.
The text thus contains 1668 sentences.

> Table 1. Words that only appear once or twice in the data set. 
The words in bold font are stand-alone sentences
and are removed from the dictionary.
     
## construct co-occurrence matrix

The corpus is then used to form dictionary words and 
context words. 
The context words are basically raw features. 
They could either be description of a specific feature, as the 
ones listed in Table 2, or referring to an organ.

feature | context words
---------|----------
left-right | left, right, bilateral 
--- | ----
front-back | anterior, posterior 
--- | ---
up-down | apex, base
--- | ---
distribution | patchy, focal, streaky, diffuse, scattered 
--- | ---
shape | round, irregular 
--- | ---
stage | acute, chronic
--- | ---
size | small, large
---- | ---
visibility | prominent, obscured 
--- | --- 
severity | mild, severe, moderate, borderline

## appendix: the full data set 

The full data set is shown as follows.
The 'root' node is only for display purposes.
All words in blue boxes except 'root' are the root words
in MeSH sentences.
The qualifiers are in orange boxes.
A blank orange box means that the root word can be used alone.
