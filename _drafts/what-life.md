I read this book about 11 years ago and my take-home message then was
that **living organisms consume negative entropy to stay alive**.

After this read, I take a little more. Basically Schrodinger tries to answer three questions:

* What is the material basis of genes? Note that this book was published in 1944 and [DNA structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) was discovered in 1953.
* How does living matter evade the decay to thermodynamic equilibrium?
* What is consciousness?

Interestingly, to reconcile the two paradoxes

* one world many minds
* one mind many cells (on an individual level)

Schrodinger takes the view that there is only one mind.
