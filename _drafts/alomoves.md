Recently I discovered a new home workout service by [Alo Moves](https://www.alomoves.com/).
It's a paid service for on-demand and live streaming exercise videos
(mostly yoga). So far it has worked very well for me:

- One of my favorite instructor [Dharma Mittra](https://www.dharmayogacenter.com/)
  has asana and pranayama classes on their platform
- There are series of daily classes lasting for a month focusing on one skill.
- There are short classes of 20 or 30 minutes long so it's easy to attend one.
- It's even cheaper than [ClassPass](https://classpass.com/). Mine is $199 for
  a year.

Here is a sample of Dharma's charging practice on Youtube

I also have a referral link.
By signing up from this referral link, you will get a free 30-day trial, and I
will get $25 credit.

I had [ClassPass](https://classpass.com/) membership before the pandemic,
which had saved me a lot of money on gym memberships.

Unfortunately
they closed down for a long time until recently.
Due to child at home, I can only join remote classes in Hong Kong in the
late night.

I find it not ideal for me any more for the following reasons

- Each class is at least 60 minutes long thus hard to find time to attend
- The on-demand classes (not in person streaming) are too similar to the
  Youtube videos. Thus it doesn't make sense to pay the membership.
