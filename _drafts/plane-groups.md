17 plane groups

You can think of unit cell as a wall paper (not necessarily a rectangular one)

## Symmetry operations

- 1: identity
- m: mirror
- rotations: 2, 3, 4, 6
- g: glide
- translations

In this post, I will categorize the plane groups using the number of
**non-identity** **non-translation** symmetry operations.
Here I also list them

- oblique (2): p1, p2
- rectangular (5): pm, pg, p2mg, p2mm, p2gg
- square (3): p4, p4mm, p4gm
- centered rectangular (2): cm, c2mm
- hexagonal (5): p3, p31m, p3m1, p6, p6mm

Before we start, we can roughly estimate the number of possible groups:

- 0 symmetry: 1
- 1 symmetry: $$P(6, 1) = 6$$ (pick one symmetry from m, g, and 4 possible rotations)
- 2 symmetries: $$P(3, 2) = 6$$ (pick 2 symmetries from m, g, and 1 possible rotation)
- 3 symmetries: $$P(3, 3) = 6$$ (pick 3 symmetries from m, g, and 1 possible rotation)

This estimation says there are 19 plane groups.

## 0 symmetry

There is only one plane group in this category, the p1.

Z'=1
