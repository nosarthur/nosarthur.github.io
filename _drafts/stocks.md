In this post, I will go over what I learnt about stock investment,
mainly the big picture instead of technical details.
The ideal reader is someone who knows little to none of stocks.

Here are the topics covered:

- [the big picture](#pic)
- [goal setting](#goal)
- [style & strategies](#ss)
- [techniques: fundamental and technical analyses](#tech)
- [tax consequences](#tax)
- [robinhood and webull](#rw)
- [miscellaneous information](#info)

## <a name='pic'></a> the big picture

There are 5 main [asset classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_classes)
for an individual.

- cash & cash equivalents
- fixed income, i.e., bonds
- equities, i.e., stocks
- commodities, e.g., gold, oil
- real estate

These asset classes have different characters (e.g., risks and returns) thus
can be mixed in various proportions to suit different goals.

According to
[Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard),
the US stock market contains 11 sectors,

- Energy
- Materials
- Industrials
- Consumer Discretionary
- Consumer Staples
- Health Care
- Financials
- Information Technology
- Communication Services
- Utilities
- Real Estate

Each sector contains various industries, and under each industry are the tickers
of individual stocks. In total there are about 3600 domestic companies' stock
traded in the US stock market.
By buying and holding stocks, we become owners of the
issuing companies, and our investment appreciate or depreciate according to the
companies' performance.

Besides the stocks issued by individual companies, there are also
[index fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund)s and
[exchange-traded fund (ETF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund)s
which can be traded like stocks.
They basically package multiple stocks (a sector or an industry or other criteria),
or certain assets (bonds, gold, silver, etc) into one entity, like a combo.
For example,

- SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (ticker: DIA): it tracks
  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)
  which tracks the stock performance of 30 large companies in the United States.
  Since there are only 30 companies, you may as well buy their individual stocks.
- Vanguard 500 Index Fund (ticker: VFINX), or Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (ticker: VOO),
  or SPDR S&P 500 ETF (ticker: SPY), or  iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (ticker: IVV):
  they track [S&P 500 Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index),
  which tracks the stock performance of 500 large companies in the United States.
- PowerShares QQQ (ticker: QQQ): 100 NASDAQ-listed stocks.
- iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ticker: IWM): The index selects stocks ranked 1,001-3,000 by market cap.
- Wilshire 5000 Index Investment Fund (ticker: WFIVX), or Vanguard Total Stock
  Market Index (ticker: VTSMX)
- ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (ticker: NOBL): it tracks
  S&P 500 constituents that have increased dividend payments annually for at
  least 25 years.
- iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (ticker: AGG):

Stock investment is to grow wealth from owning part of the
global economy. I can think of 3 reasons to buy stocks.

**First of all, it provides high returns in the long run.**
You can easily find market data online nowadays.
For example, check the following links

- [Average Stock Market Return](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/average-stock-market-return/)
- [Average S&P 500 Annual Return](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp)

> The stock market has historically returned an average of 10% annually,
  before inflation. However, stock market returns vary greatly from year-to-year,
  and rarely fall into that average.

In the following image, you can see that the stock market has long bullish periods
and short bearish periods.
For short-term investment, there is no guarantee to profit.
In the long run, say 20 or 30 years, the return is very good.

**Secondly, the entry barrier for stock investment is particularly low.** After opening
an account with a brokerage firm (e.g., Robinhood, Webull, Fidelity, Vanguard,
Charles Schwab, E-Trade, M1 Finance, etc), trading stocks is simply a few mouse
clicks or finger swipes. Many firms even waived trading fees (the ones I listed
previously), thanks to the revolution brought by [Robinhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinhood_(company)).

**Finally, one can trade other asset classes on the stock market**,
which makes stock investment extremely versatile. For example,

- bonds:
  - Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (ticker: BND): BND tracks a broad, market-value-weighted index of US dollar-denominated, investment-grade, taxable, fixed-income securities with maturities of at least one year.
  - iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (ticker: AGG): AGG tracks an index of US investment-grade bonds. The market-weighted index includes Treasuries, agencies, CMBS, ABS and investment-grade corporates.
- metals:
  - SPDR Gold Trust (ticker: GLD): GLD tracks the gold spot price, less expenses and liabilities, using gold bars held in London vaults.
  - iShares Silver Trust (ticker: SLV): SLV tracks the silver spot price, less expenses and liabilities, using silver bullion held in London.
- real estate:
  - Realty Income (ticker: O): Realty Income Corporation, also called Realty Income,
    is a real estate company, which engages in generating dependable monthly cash
    dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations.
  - Safehold Inc. (ticker: SAFE): Safehold Inc. operates as a real estate investment trust, which focuses on acquiring, owning, managing and capitalizing ground leases. It seeks to provide safe & growing income, as well as capital appreciation to shareholders by building a diversified portfolio of ground leases. The company's property is generally leased on a triple net basis with the tenant responsible for taxes, maintenance and insurance, as well as all operating costs and capital expenditures.

## <a name='goal'></a> goal setting

With a clear goal, we can measure performance and adjust strategies.

- purpose
- monetary value
- time span

Let's take retirement planning as an example.
Suppose you are currently 30 years old and you will retire at age 67. This is
the age to claim full social security benefit in the United States, see
[here](https://www.nasi.org/learn/socialsecurity/retirement-age). Then the time
span is 37 years. You can also use 59.5 as retirement age, which is the age
to withdraw money from IRA and 401k plans without penalty. In that case, the
time span is 29.5 years.

According to [survey data from United Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy),
the life expectancies in United States are

female | male
--- | ---
81.1 |78.6

Thus we need to have enough money for at least 10 years after retirement.

To get a rough estimate, we can use the
[4 percent rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study).
It basically says the retirees can take out 4% of their portfolio each year
without running out of money in their life span (recall the average stock
market annual return is 10%). Thus we just need to multiple the annual living
cost by 25 to get an estimate.

For concreteness, let's assume the following breakdowns

item | annual cost (USD)
--- |---
housing | $1000 * 12 = 12,000
food | $600 * 12 = 7,200
health insurance | $4,300 (see [here](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2019/07/07/how-much-will-health-insurance-cost-in-retirement.aspx))

Adding a little cushion, we can assume the annual retirement cost is $25,000.
Multiplying 25 and we get $625,000.


For any investment, we need to know how much money needs to be made within
some time span. For example, to get 12% annual return, 1% profit needs to be
made each month, or 0.23% each week.

At a higher level, the goal is about why.




## <a name='ss'></a> style & strategies

Like any activities in life, investment only works when it suits one's
personality. Otherwise it could cause tremendous anxiety no matter the stock
price goes up or down.

In principle, there are essentially two styles: passive or active.

The extreme form of the passive style is to spend a fixed amount of money to
buy SPY or other index funds with a fixed period regardless of the price.
Nothing is sold before retirement.
This is known as [dollar cost averaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging),
and historical data prove its effectiveness.

The other extreme is day trading where no stock is held overnight. Any profit
or loss is realized in the trading hours. In the United States, the regular
hour is from 9:30am to 4pm EST.
The extended hours starts from 4am and ends at 8pm.
Note that to qualify for day trading, there needs to be $25k equity in the account.

In practice, there is a full spectrum between the extremes.

- Are you eager to understand how everything works?
- Are you hard working?
- Do you give up?

If your answers are not positive, a more passive style may work better.

If you decide to be on the more active side, you need to figure out the

- portfolio, i.e., what stocks to own
- timing, i.e., when to buy/sell

Public companies are required to disclose their business structures and
financial situation.
SEC fillings
You can find the reports on their websites

- 10-K: annual report
- 10-Q: quarterly report
- 8-K: important unscheduled material events

For someone with a full time job, any holding time less than a day probably
wouldn't work.


### dividend stocks

- valueline
- investor relations, then look for 10k form

[BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. SHAREHOLDER LETTERS](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html)

### index funds and ETFs

The main difference between ETF and index fund is that ETFs trade throughout
the day while index funds trade once at market close.

## <a name='tech'></a> techniques: fundamental and technical analyses

## <a name='tax'></a> tax consequences

tax loss harvesting

There are three stock events that affects your income, thus your tax.

- stock gain
- stock loss
- dividends


The gain or loss occur when the stock is sold. Otherwise the price change is
unrealized gain/loss and is not taxed.

Since they originates from owning a business, they are taxed as capital gains.
The 2019 tax rates for capital gain are

type | holding time | income range|tax rate
--- | ---| ---
short-term capital gain | < 1 year | | same as ordinary income
long-term capital gain | > 1 year | single filer < $39,375 or married < $78,750 | 0%
long-term capital gain | > 1 year | single filer $39,375 to $434,550 or married $78,751 to $488,850 | 15%
long-term capital gain | > 1 year | single filer > $434,550 or married file jointly > $488,850 | 20%

Note that they are much lower than ordinary income tax rates.
In other words, the government encourages everyone to become a business owner
by granting tax benefits.

If you lose money in stock, the loss can be used to write off stock gains.
If you have a net loss, you can write off up to $3,000 each year against your other income.

Dividend income is considered either as short-term or long-term capital gains
depending on the stock holding time. This holding time required is less than a year.
You can see the details here for
['qualified dividend'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_dividend).

Note the aforementioned rules only apply to ordinary stocks.
The stocks containing other asset classes may be taxed differently.

## <a name='rw'></a> robinhood and webull

Margin account allows you to borrow money from the brokerage firm to increase
the leverage.

Webull free margin account.

Robinhood margin account costs $5/month.
