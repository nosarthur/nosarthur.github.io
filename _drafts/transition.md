Recently I left my postdoc job and became a software developer.
In this post I will share my experience on the process.

## background

I received PhD in physics in 2011 and remained in postdoc positions until 2016.
As time progresses, industry appears more and more appealing.

There are two reasons for my transition to industry

* lack of vision in research
* lack of financial freedom

Although I have been in school for many years 
(a fully zodiac cycle after college), I didn't reach the point to have a clear long term research plan.
In my opinion, this lack of vision is fatal to academic career: after all, destination is hard to reach by random walk.

In term of daily life, the postdoc experience is quite pleasant:
flexible hours, helpful coworkers/supervisors. I was also lucky that 
all my supervisors since graduate school are quite hands-off 
and are willing to let me pick my own pace and (side) projects.
Unfortunately it is not a real job in terms of compensation and stability.  

For example, data scientist jobs pay a median base salary $104k (add 13k if you have a PhD) in the US according to [the O'Reilly's 2015 survey](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/2015-data-science-salary-survey/). In addition, there are other benefits (may be of comparable amount to the base) besides the base salary.

## timeline 

* Left postdoc job in May 2016
* Started application in July 
* Went on interviews in August 
* Accepted offer in September 
* Started working in October

## 

* Do let people know that you are looking for job



* I have a lot of friends working for top companies in industry
* No industry experience


## industry options

For a physics PhD (probably other STEM PhD too),
there are three options in industry

* data science
* software development
* finance

Basically, there are three sets of knowledge

* statistics
* machine learning
* coding
    * algorithms
    * SQL


## mental preparations

fear for change

I gradually realize that the right thing to do is the one that
I want to do but don't feel comfortable doing.
Let me give some concrete examples

* wanted & comfortable: e.g., lay flat in bed
* not wanted & comfortable: e.g., watch [The Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire) again
* wanted & not comfortable: find a job in industry
* not wanted & not comfortable: start [P90X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P90X)


## my job applications 

I also heard that to get into GE, Siemens, and IBM, one needs to have
internal connections.
