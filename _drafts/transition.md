## who am I 

## why data scientist

## my timeline 

* Left postdoc job on May 6, 2016.

## after thoughts

* Let as many people as possible know that you are looking for jobs.
* Don't apply if you won't accept the offer. 

## learning resources

* [dataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io)
    
    I discovered this site in late July and wished I could have found it much earlier. 
    It is an online learning platform for breaking into data analyst, data scientist and data engineer jobs. The premium subscription is $49/month. 
    The nice thing is that you can video chat with the founder [Vik Paruchuri](http://www.vikparuchuri.com) for 10 min every week.
* [Stanford database course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about)

    I do not have experience with SQL before and this course taught me the basics.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [LeetCode solutions](https://lefttree.gitbooks.io/leetcode-categories/content/index.html)
