## who am I 

* Strength
    * My math and coding background enables me to learn new tools quickly.
* Weakness:
    * No industry experience
    * No machine learning experience

## why data scientist

* low pay in academia

* business analyst: report 
    * statistics
    * SQL
* machine learning software development engineer: product
    * machine learning
    * software development

## my timeline 

* Left postdoc job in early May 2016
* Start application in late July 2016
* Accept offer  in 

## after thoughts

* Do let people know that you are looking for job
* Do participate in [kaggle][1] competitions ASAP
* Don't waste time on deep learning 
* Don't apply if you won't accept the offer 

Many of my former classmates and colleagues are working as data scientists in industry. Two of them even wrote a book on [Data Science Interview Exposed](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Interviews-Exposed-Yanping-Huang/dp/1511977485).

## learning resources

Basically, there are three sets of knowledge

* statistics
* machine learning
* coding
    * algorithms
    * SQL

The following 

* [kaggle][1] and [drivendata](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/)

* [dataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io)
    
    I discovered this site in late July and wished I could have found it much earlier. 
    It is an online learning platform for breaking into data analyst, data scientist and data engineer jobs. The premium subscription is $49/month. 
    The nice thing is that you can video chat with the founder [Vik Paruchuri](http://www.vikparuchuri.com) for 10 min every week as office hour.
* [Stanford database course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about)

    I do not have experience with SQL before and this course taught me the basics.
* coding preparation
    * [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [LeetCode solutions](https://lefttree.gitbooks.io/leetcode-categories/content/index.html)
    * [codewars](http://codewars.com) 
* books
    * Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney
    * Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka
* data science programs

    There are many short-term programs nowaday to help people break ice into the data scientist jobs, 
    e.g., [insight](http://insightdatascience.com), [data incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/). I have interviews with insight but didn't get in. Here are the demos that didn't get me into the insight data science program.
