## who am I 

I received PhD in theoretical physics in 2011 and remained in postdoc positions until 2016.


* Strength
    * My math and coding background enables me to learn new tools quickly.
    * I have a lot of friends working for top companies in industry
* Weakness:
    * No industry experience

## why transition

There are two major reason for my transition

* lack of vision in research
* lack of financial freedom

Although I have been in school for many years (a fully zodiac cycle after college), I never have the clarity of a long term research plan.
In my opinion, this lack of vision is vital to academic career: after all, destination is hard to reach by random walk.

I was more interest-driven instead of goal-driven.

low pay in academia

## my timeline 

* Left postdoc job in May 2016
* Start application in July 2016
* Accept offer  in 

* Do let people know that you are looking for job

## learning resources

Basically, there are three sets of knowledge

* statistics
* machine learning
* coding
    * algorithms
    * SQL

The following 


* [dataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io)
    
    I discovered this site in late July and wished I could have found it much earlier. 
    It is an online learning platform for breaking into data analyst, data scientist and data engineer jobs. The premium subscription is $49/month. 
    The nice thing is that you can video chat with the founder [Vik Paruchuri](http://www.vikparuchuri.com) for 10 min every week as office hour.
