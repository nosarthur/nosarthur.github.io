Various scientific and engineering problems boil down to solving
partial differential equations (PDEs).
Major applications include electro-magnetism, material properties (mechanical,
thermal, etc), and dynamics ([molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics),
[diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion), etc).
Often times, the same types of equations appear in different fields.
The most common ones are

* elliptic equations
* parabolic equations
* hyperbolic equations
* wave equations
* Newton's second law

In this post, I will explain the two most important numerical solvers for PDEs:
the finite difference method (FD) and the finite element method (FE).
In case this post is too long to read, there are a few key points:

* Not all PDEs have meaningful (numerical) solutions
* FD is not as straightforward as replacing differentiation with finite difference:
  the choice of the [finite difference scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference)
  (forward, backward, central, etc) determines not only the accuracy but also
  the convergence (or non-convergence) of the solution.
* For applications with complicated geometric shapes / boundary conditions,
  FE is better suited than FD.
* One may write in-house FD solvers for the problem at hand, but may rarely
  write in-house FE due to its complexity and the handiness of commercial softwares
  such as [COMSOL multiphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMSOL_Multiphysics),
  [HFSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFSS), [Sonnet](https://www.sonnetsoftware.com),
  etc.

## introduction

Not many PDEs have closed-form analytical solutions.

* analytical theories
* numerical methods
    * finite difference method (FD)
    * finite element method (FE)

* chaos
* nonlinear dynamics

I won't cover them in this post, you can resort to a very nice book by [Professor Steven Strogatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Strogatz) if interested:

In engineering fields, it often happens that the problem 
For example, the boundary condition may not be known, some coefficients in the PDE is only approximately known.

**The finite difference scheme matters**.
