features

- subjective
- simple

each dimension has 4 levels

The first three scales have simple rule: among the people you work with, is
the person being evaluated performs less than (level 1), same as (level 2), or
better than (level 3) average.

The difference between level 3 and level 4 is that the person enjoys and find it
instinctive to do perform at level 3.
