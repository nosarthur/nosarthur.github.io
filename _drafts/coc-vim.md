```
coc.nvim need vim >= 8.1.1719 to support features like popup and text property.
Consider upgrade your vim for better experience.
You can set this to make this error message go away:
    let g:coc_disable_startup_warning = 1
Note that some features may behave incorrectly.
```

```
sudo apt-get install vim
```
