As a physics major, I find the tree-based methods less natual to think of than the geometric methods such as logistic regression or support vector machine.


* pros
    * nonlinear
    * fast
* cons
    * overfit


To fight the overfit problem 

    * ensemble  
    * restrict the branching
    * pruning

## branching

    quantify information gain

    median

## making of forest

    * bagging
    * random feature subsets
