> The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed yet. -- William Gibson

I still remember my thrill when [MIT OCW][ocw] first came out in early 2000.
As a college student back in China, I was so happy to read the course notes and
it was clear to me that quantum mechanics was taught in more depth in MIT.
Nowadays, more and more famous schools have made their course materials available online.
There are also companies that provide online education
such as [Coursera][c], [Udacity][u] and many others.
For a comprehensive list of these online resources, check out this
