I read John Somez' first book of software developer's life manual when I broke ice
to industry job (see [my book review here]({% post_url 2016-10-16-soft-skills %})).
Compared to that book, this one is more focused on career development.
Basically, it talks about
how to get started as a software developer for a beginner,
how to advance career for mid-career developer,
and how to break the glass ceilings for experience professional.

This book is structured as Q and A at chapter level,
and the chapters are categorized into five sections:

* Getting started as a software developer
* Getting a job
* What you need to know about software development
* Working as a developer
* Advancing your career

The chapters are more-or-less independent, thus you can pick the relevant part to read.
(I read it from cover to cover and it took 6 days.)

It contains a lot of useful information and I highly recommend it,
especially for someone trying to enter the software developer world.
In addition, its price is unbelievably low for its content:
the Kindle version is only $4.99 and it is also included in the Kindle Unlimited subscription.
