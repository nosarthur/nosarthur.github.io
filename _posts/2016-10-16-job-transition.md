Recently I left my postdoc job and became a software developer.
In this post I will share my experience and some random thoughts 
looking back.

## background

I received PhD in physics in 2011 and remained in postdoc positions until 2016.
As time progresses, industry appears more and more appealing, for two reasons

* lack of vision in research
* lack of financial freedom

Although I have been in school for many years 
(a full zodiac cycle after college), I didn't reach the point to have clear long term research plans.
In my opinion, this lack of vision is fatal to academic career. After all, destination (professorship) is hard to reach by random walk.

In term of daily life, the postdoc experience is pleasant:
flexible hours, helpful coworkers/supervisors, etc. I was lucky enough that 
all my supervisors since college are quite hands-off 
and are willing to let me pick my own pace and (side) projects.
Unfortunately postdoc is not a real job in terms of compensation and stability,
and New York city is really expensive ([bjj][bjj] $250/month, [yoga][yoga] $239/month, [climbing][climb] $150/month, [karate][karate] $130/month, etc).

For these reasons, I decided to quit postdoc and give a try in industry.

## industry options

For a physics PhD (probably other STEM PhD too),
there are essentially three options in industry

1. software development
2. data science
1. finance

The difficulty increases by the ordering. The required skills overlap to some 
degree. So it doesn't hurt to prepare for two or even all three of them.
Basically, there are three sets of skills

* coding
    * algorithms
    * database 
* statistics/probability theory/stochastic processes
* machine learning

Honestly I am not well prepared in any of them at the time of my application.
But from talking to friends in industry and going through interviews,
I have got some idea of how to prepare and to what degree they should be prepared. This topic will be covered in a future post (or maybe posts).

## mental preparations

In my observation, doing something new is usually relatively easy whereas putting the mind to it could be hard.
For good biological reasons the mind seeks for consistency (see [this book]({% post_url 2016-07-31-influence %}) for example) and fears for change.
In my case, making up the mind to quit postdoc is the hard part whereas looking 
for jobs is actually quite fun.

If you are debating between options, it may help to reflect on the 
question of "who am I". It's usually not fun to copy someone else's life and a lot
of fun to find your own answer.

Meanwhile it may help to overcome some physical challenges to gain extra mental
strength, for example, run a marathon or finish a [P90X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P90X) session.
