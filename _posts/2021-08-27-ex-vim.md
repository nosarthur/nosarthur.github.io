This post is about the colon commands in Vim. For example,
the substitution command takes the form of
```
:[range]s/<pattern>/<replacement>/[options]
```

Such commands are inherited from a line editor called [Ex][ex]
(or even Ex' predecessor [Ed][ed]).
Other common Ex commands include
`:e`, `:q`, `:r`, `:w`, `:3` (or any other line number).

## commands and symbols

A full list of Ex commands and range symbols are

keys | meaning
--- | ---
`a` | append text
`c` | change (replace) text
`d` | delete, e.g., `3,5d`
`e` | edit file
`i` | insert text
`f` | show file information or switch file name
`g` | global action, e.g., `g/bad/d`
`m` | move, e.g., `1,3m$`
`p` | print lines
`q` | quit
`r` | read file into buffer
`s` | substitute
`t` | copy
`v` or `g!`| global action on lines that don't contain a pattern
`w` | write to file
`/` | context search, e.g., `/word/+1d`
`.` | current line
`$` | last line
`%` | every line
`+` and `-` | line number arithmetics
`,` | range, e.g., `8,20`
`;` | relative range, e.g., `.;+5`
`0` | before 1st line

Here the commands `a`, `c`, `i` trigger an input terminal at the bottom of Vim
and a line of a single `.` ends the input.

You can test these keys directly in Vim, or read the help information. For
example, `:help :a`.
