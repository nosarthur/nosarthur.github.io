No introduction is needed for [Steven King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King).
Maybe not this book either since it ranks No. 6 in [Time magazine's all time 100 best non-fiction books since 1923 (the year Time magazine began)][time100].

In the foreword, Steven King highly recommended [The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) (which ranks No. 1 in [Time magazine's all time 100 best non-fiction books][time100]),
and he also commented that

> This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit.

Soon it becomes obvious that this book bears no resemblance to The Elements of Style:
it is fun to read but helps little to writing skills.
In fact, this book comprises three parts:

1. CV
1. On writing
1. On living

Only the second part is related directly to writing skills.
The first part is a memoir of his life before he became a professional writer.
And the third part centers around a severe car accident in 1999.

Steven King's writing advices include:

* Avoid passive tense
* Use less adverbs
* Satisfy the formula "2nd draft = 1st draft - 10%"
* Read a lot and write a lot

He also made an observation that "fear is at the root of most bad writings".

Overall it is a great book and I highly recommend it.
