I discovered [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) a few years ago and it has
greatly improved my command line productivity.
In this post, I will explain how it works and introduce my 3 everyday usage cases.

- [basic concepts](#basics)
- 3 usage cases
  - [navigate directories with `z`](#z)
  - [kill jobs](#kill)
  - [edit source files in a git repo](#vim)

The author of fzf, [Junegunn Choi](https://github.com/junegunn),
also created [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug),
[fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim),
and other useful vim plugins.

## basic concepts <a name='basics'></a>

Fzf is a command-line fuzzy finder.

If you know the unix `pick` command, `fzf` is simply `pick` with fuzzy
filtering as you type keywords. Please feel free to skip to the usage cases.

For those who don't know `pick`, `fzf` lets you interactively
select item(s) from a list of choices.

If you run `fzf` in shell directly, the default behavior is to show all files
in current directory recursively as choices, i.e., `find * -type f`.
See the screenshot of my [gita](https://github.com/nosarthur/gita) repo.
You can use arrow keys to hover over different choices.
Typing any words will fuzzily limit the choices, and hitting the `Enter`
key makes the choice.

The default behavior is controlled by `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`. For example
you can use [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) instead of `find` by adding
the following line in the `.bashrc`

```
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f'
```

You can pass choices to `fzf` too, for example

- `ps -ef | fzf`
- `ls *.txt | fzf`
- `qstat -u $USER | fzf`
- `cat data.csv | fzf`

I use a command line note taking program called [notes](https://github.com/pimterry/notes),
and I have this line in my `.bashrc`

```bash
alias vn='n ls |fzf | n o'
```

This `vn` alias opens a note via `fzf` selection.
Here `n` is my alias to `notes`,  `n ls` lists the documents and `n o` opens
the one picked by `fzf`.

## navigate directories with `z` <a name='z'></a>

I use [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) to change directories. It maintains a list
of directories to `cd` into, based on frequency and recentness.
With `fzf` integration, you can see the choices explicitly.

```bash
z() {
  [ $# -gt 0 ] && _z "$*" && return
  cd "$(_z -l 2>&1 | fzf --height 40% --nth 2.. --reverse --inline-info +s --tac --query "${*##-* }" | sed 's/^[0-9,.]* *//')"
}
```

## kill jobs <a name='kill'></a>

In my work, I use `qstat` to view submitted jobs to [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer)
clusters and `qdel` to delete unwanted jobs.
The same idea in this section works for deleting local jobs with `ps` and `kill` too.
However that integration is shipped with `fzf`: try `kill <tab>`.

By default, `fzf` only makes one choice. To allow multiple choices with `tab`
key, add this line in `.bashrc`
```bash
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --layout=reverse --border --multi'
```

My alias to kill jobs is
```bash
alias qd='qdel `q | tail -n +3| fzf | ff 1`'
```

Here `ff` is a custom script to extract a column:

```bash
awk "{ print \$$1 }"
```
which I stole from [The Unix Programming Environment](https://amzn.to/2YDusbr).

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013937681X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=013937681X&linkCode=as2&tag=nosarthur2016-20&linkId=618773dc18a5b83a85419b2af79634f1"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=013937681X&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=nosarthur2016-20" ></a>

It is more versatile than hard coding a field in the `awk` command.

And `q` is my tailored `qstat` command
```bash
alias q='qstat -u $USER| tee >(tail -n +3 |wc -l)'
```

The `tail -n +3` command gets rid of the header of the `qstat` output.

## edit source files in a git repo <a name='vim'></a>

With the help of `fzf` and [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim), I
always stay at the root of git repos to edit files.
While one can use ``vim `fzf` ``, the following function is more powerful.


```bash
fe() {
  IFS=$'\n' files=($(fzf-tmux --query="$1" --multi --select-1 --exit-0))
  [[ -n "$files" ]] && ${EDITOR:-vim} -O "${files[@]}" -p
}
```

Notice that `--multi` allows multiple selections by `tab` key.
The `-O` option for `vim` opens multiple files in vertical splits
(`-p` may also be a good choice).

When already in `vim`, you can use the following shortcuts to open files
```
let mapleader = ","
nmap <leader>f :GFiles!<CR>
nmap <leader>o :Files!<CR>
```

These two `vim` colon commands are defined by `fzf.vim` and there are other
useful ones such as `:Rg`, `:BLines`, `:BCommits`, etc.
