As an avid reader with bad sleep hygiene, my eyes often hurt.
To alleviate the pain,
I bought an Amazon Kindle oasis recently to lessen the iPad and Chromebook usage.
It proves to be a great idea: my eye strain seems to reduce and it's also
easier to hold in the subway.

Mine is the 2016 model (8th generation) with a detachable charging cover.
It has a nice design like a small notebook.
In the picture below, you can see how it compares to my weekly agenda.

There is a newer 2017 model with faster processor and water-proof casing.
The two are similarly priced, and I prefer the 2016 model because

* it is lighter: 131g without the charging cover versus 194g without cover;
* it has smaller screen: 6 inch versus 7 inch.
  Smaller screen translates to less eye movements, thus improves read speed.
  In extreme cases, some speed reading methods such as [spritz](http://spritzinc.com/) or [speeder](https://www.spreeder.com/) advocate only one word on the screen at a time.

Kindle comes with a nice feature called [Amazon Word Wise](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1002989731),
which displays a short-and-simple definition on top of the more difficult words.
And the amount of words to be annotated can be controlled (I have it on the maximum setting).
In addition, dictionary lookup and Wikipedia lookup can be triggered by long-pressing the word.
Once looked up, the word is recorded and can be reviewed in Kindle's Vocabulary Builder.
All these features are quite useful for youngsters or non-native speakers like me.

As for shortcomings, it does not do well with technical books and PDF files.
Thus I have pretty much sticked to non-technical books,
with the exceptions of some O'Reilly publications.
