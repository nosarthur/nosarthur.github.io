Last July I bought a Samsung Chromebook Pro for my wife.
In my imagination,
it would be a good gift since she exclusively uses google docs/sheets for work and web browser for entertainment --
exactly what Chromebook provides.
In addition, this Chromebook is pretty light-weight (2.4 lbs), pretty thin (0.5"), equipped with touch screen,
has about 7 hours battery time for video streaming, and even has a built-in stylus for writing.

Unfortunately she was not amused by any of these features and thus I got a new toy.
It is a very powerful machine (Intel Core m3 processor, 4G RAM, 32G flash storage) and is definitely an overkill for just Youtube streaming and web browsing.
To set up a coding environment, I found the following options at the time:

* wipe out the Chrome OS and install some linux distro (welcome to the 90s or early 2000s)
* turn on the so-called developer mode (note that this voids the warranty and there is risk to accidentally wipe the disc at boot up by pressing the space key) and then
	* install Ubuntu as dual boot
    * use an app called Crouton to dual boot another linux distro
* keep the original Chrome OS and
    * code with text editors like Caret (without running it)
	* code on external websites like [Cloud9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9_IDE)
    * ssh to some remote machine (for example, google provides a [free f1-micro instance with 30G disc and 0.6G RAM](https://cloud.google.com/free/))

I didn't like any of them and reluctantly opted for the ssh option at the time.
As a result, the Chromebook is basically useless without fast internet connection.

Fortunately, I discovered an Android app called [Termux](https://termux.com/) recently.
It is a linux terminal emulator that runs on both Android phones and some Chromebooks (see a full list of them [here](https://www.androidcentral.com/these-are-chromebooks-can-run-android-apps)).
Specially the following tools run smoothly in a bash terminal without internet connection:

* vim
* git
* latex
* python
* go
* gcc/g++
* make
* tmux

They are basically all I need for coding.
It is such a game changer that now I can do real work on this Chromebook.
In fact I even find it more preferable than my MacBook Pro:
it is much easier to carry around, and for coding its battery time is over 10 hours.

To instal termux, you can visit this link:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux

There are a few must-have extensions

* `pkg install termux-setup-storage`: it allows you to access the Chromebook file systems (downloads, music, pictures, etc)
* `pkg install termux-exec`: better support for bash
* `pkg install diffutils`: this is needed for `vimdiff` to work properly
* `pkg install python-dev`: this is needed for `LDFLAGS=" -lm -lcompiler_rt" pip install numpy`
* `pkg install pkg-config`: somehow this is needed for `pip install matplotlib`, otherwise it complains that `freetype` is not present (although it is)

For `matplotlib` to work properly, you also need to create a config file at `~/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc` with the following content:

```
backend : agg
```

You may wonder why I bother installing `matplotlib` in bash.
The trick is that with `jupyter notebook --ip='0.0.0.0'`, you can see the plots directly in Chrome.

To install scipy, the easiest way is to use its-pointless repo.
All the community repos can be seen [from this link](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management#Community_Repositories).

To install fonts and templates from various publishers, run
```
tlmgr install collection-publishers
tlmgr install times textcase
```

Termux also supports multiple sessions (like the old linux tty1, tty2, etc).
The shortcuts are

* `ctrl+alt+c`: create a new session
* `ctrl+alt+n`: goto next session
* `ctrl+alt+p`: goto previous session
* `ctrl+alt+[1-9]`: goto the numbered session

For more of these shortcuts, visit the [termux keyboard page](https://termux.com/hardware-keyboard.html).
I notice that you can also pull out the drawer (to see all sessions) by clicking and holding at the left edge of the screen.

## issues

The general complaints I have for this Samsung Chromebook Pro are

* ~~The keyboard kinda sucks: the keys are somewhat small and the layout is too crowded.~~ (I gradually get used to it, now the Macbook keyboard feels weird...)
* It's too easy to hit the power button accidentally.
* ~~It cannot connect to my company's VPN.~~ (There is an Android app called VpnCilla that does the trick for $4.99. Also remember to enable chrome://flags/#arc-vpn)
* There is no out-of-box way to display the date in the status bar. One has to move the mouse over the clock to see the date. I don't know what the rationale is behind this...

The complaints I have for termux include

* ~~Pasting into the vim doesn't work although pasting into shell works by long press. My current workaround is to either use `echo <content> >> <file>` or paste into nano.~~ (Paste is `ctrl+alt+v`, works inside vim too, goodbye nano, goodbye long press)
* Access to `http://localhost` is not granted. My current workaround is to host web apps at `0.0.0.0` and access the termux's IP `100.115.92.2` to test out.
* ~~Jekyll cannot be installed.~~ (`pkg install libffi-dev` first)
* Python multiprocessing module doesn't work. As a result, flake8 doesn't work and I have to use (the inferior) pyflakes instead.
