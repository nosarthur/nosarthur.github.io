Last July I bought a Samsung Chromebook Pro for my wife.
In my imagination,
it would be a good gift since she exclusively uses google docs/sheets for work and web browser for entertainment --
exactly what Chromebook provides.
In addition, this Chromebook is pretty light-weight (2.4 lbs), pretty thin (0.5"), equipped with touch screen,
has about 7 hours battery time for video streaming, and even has a built-in stylus for writing.

Unfortunately she was not amused by any of these features and thus I got a new toy.
It is a very powerful machine and is definitely an overkill for just Youtube streaming and web browsing.
To set up a coding environment, I found the following options at the time:

* wipe out the Chrome OS and install some linux distro (welcome to the 90s or early 2000s)
* turn on the so-called developer mode (note that this voids the warranty and there is risk to accidentally wipe the disc at boot up by pressing the space key) and
	* install Ubuntu as dual boot
    * use an app called Crouton to dual boot another linux distro
* keep the original Chrome OS and
    * code with text editors like Caret
	* code on external websites like [Cloud9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9_IDE)
    * ssh to some remote machine (for example, google provides a [free f1-micro instance with 30G disc and 0.6G RAM](https://cloud.google.com/free/))

I didn't like any of them and reluctantly opted for the ssh option at the time.
As a result, the Chromebook is basically useless without fast internet connection.

Fortunately, I discovered an app called [Termux](https://termux.com/) recently, which makes coding much easier on Chromebook.
It is a terminal emulator for the linux environment, and runs on Android phones and Chromebooks.
After all, [Chrome OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS) is built on the linux kernel.
Specially the following tools can run smoothly in a bash terminal without internet connection:

* vim
* git
* latex
* python
* go
* gcc/g++
* tmux
* make

They are basically all I need.
It is such a game changer and now I can do real work on this Chromebook.
In fact I even find it more preferable than my MacBook Pro:
it is much easier to carry around, and for coding its battery time is over 10 hours.

## issues

The general complaints I have for this Samsung Chromebook Pro are

* The keyboard kinda sucks: the keys are somewhat small and the layout is too crowded.
* It's easy to hit the power button accidentally.
* It cannot connect to my company's VPN.
* There is no out-of-box way to display the date in the status bar.

The complaints I have for termux include

* Pasting into the vim doesn't work although pasting into shell works by long press. My current workaround is to either use `echo <content> >> <file>` or paste into nano.
* Access to `http://localhost` is not granted. My current workaround is to access the machine's real IP to test my local web app.
* Jekyll cannot be installed.
* Python multiprocessing module doesn't work. As a result, flake8 doesn't work and I have to use pyflakes instead.
