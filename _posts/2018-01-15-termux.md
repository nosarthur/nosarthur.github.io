Last July I bought a Samsung Chromebook Pro for my wife.
In my imagination,
it would be a good gift since she exclusively uses google docs/sheets for work and web browser for entertainment --
exactly what Chromebook provides (excels?).
In addition, this Chromebook is pretty light (2.4 lbs), pretty thin (0.5"), equipped with touch screen, 
has about 7 hours battery time for video streaming, and even has a built-in stylus.

Unfortunately she was not amused by any of these features and thus I got a new toy.
It is a very powerful machine and is definitely an overkill for just Youtube streaming and web browsing.
To set up a coding environment, I found the following options at the time:

* wipe out the Chrome OS and install some linux distro (welcome to the 90s or early 2000s)
* turn on the so-called developer mode (note that it voids the warranty and there is risk to accidentally wipe the disc at boot up by pressing the space key) and 
	* install Ubuntu as dual boot
    * use an app called Crouton to dual boot other linux distro
* keep the original Chrome OS and
    * code with text editors like Caret
	* code on external websites like [Cloud9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9_IDE)
    * ssh to some remote machine (for example, google provides a [free f1-micro instance with 30G disc and 0.6G RAM](https://cloud.google.com/free/))

Honestly I didn't like any of them and reluctantly opted for the ssh option at the time.
As a result, the Chromebook is basically useless without internet connection.
For me, the ideal situation would be to use the original OS as a native linux environment.

Recently, I discovered an app called [Termux](https://termux.com/), which made my ideal situation a reality.
It is a terminal emulator for the linux environment, and runs on Android phones and Chromebooks.
Specially the following tools can run smoothly in a bash terminal without internet connection:

* vim
* git
* latex
* python
* go
* gcc/g++

They are basically all I need.
It is such a game changer and now I can do real work on this Chromebook.
Note that it is much easier to carry around than the MacBook Pro, and its battery time is close to 10 hours for coding.

## issues

The general complaints I have for this Samsung Chromebook Pro are

* The keyboard kinda sucks: the keys are somewhat small and the layout is too crowded.
* It's easy to hit the power button accidentally.
* It cannot connect to my company's VPN.
* There is no out-of-box way to display the date in the status bar.

The complaints I have for termux

* Copy/paste into the vim doesn't work. My current workaround is to use nano to copy/paste (lame).
* Access to `http://localhost` is not granted. My current workaround is to access the machine's real IP to test my local web app.
* Jekyll cannot be installed.
