I went to school in University of Wisconsin-Madison where they have the
second largest sailing club in the United States, second only to the US Navy club.
The so-called [Hoofers sailing club](http://www.hoofersailing.org) is extremely affordable (less than $200 annual membership in 2011 for students) and one can take unlimited lessons and check out equipments without limit as long as he/she holds the corresponding ratings.
In the summer time you can do all the sailings. In the winter time you can do [ice kiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite_ice_skating) on the lake surface. Members also organize trips to windsurf at warmer places. 

Although I have ratings for most small to median sail boats, I almost never check them out.
My real interest is in windsurfing, for two reasons

* It takes less than 5 minutes to get into the water for windsurfers but takes much longer to rig the sails and dock/undock the sail boats.
* The windsurfing mast is not fixed to the board thus allowing more interesting maneuvering (freestyle) than sailing boats. 

One particularly fun thing about windsurfing (and some sailing boats too) is [planing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planing_(boat)).
With big enough wind and sail, the board floats above water and only the fin keeps contact with water.
In this state, friction is minimum and I find it like flying on a piece of cloud.

Windsurfing is a very good sport to practice one's awareness, both to the body and to the environment.
The sail needs to be constantly adjusted to the wind (the wind on [Lake Mendota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mendota) is quite shitty).
You will also need to read the ripples for the gusts. Without good body control, it's also not possible to enter the planing state.

My friend Chamond has a windsurfing site with a lot of information

If you happen to visit Madison, WI in the summer, sailing/windsurfing can be a fun option.
