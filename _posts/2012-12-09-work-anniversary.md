It has been 14 months since I joined industry and it has been an inspiring experience.
What I enjoyed most are:

* acquiring new skills and knowledges
* observing ideas evolve to products
* being with people who like what they are doing and are willing to share what they know

Compared to my previous academia experience, industry job has two differences

* less ownership
* more coordination with coworkers

The root of these differences is that industry products need to work in most situations whereas research papers only demonstrate feasibility in certain situations.
As a result, a lot of effort is spent on making the workflow robust and the interface user friendly, even if the underlying idea is straightforward. It requires expertise of many people and collaboration from different teams to make things happen.

Two skills thus become important

* communication
* bookkeeping

both of which I need to work on more in the future.

In terms of tools and domain knowledges, I have learned in the past year

* git
* testing (pytest in particular)
* design patterns
* AWS
* a little bit of docker
* a little bit of golang (web services in particular)
* a little bit of free energy perturbation

In particular, git and automated testing provide great help to keep sanity in face of changes.
Design patterns help to organize and maintain large size of code.
And AWS alleviates the burden of hardware.

Sometimes I also think about how to get better in general.
For example, I see intellectual capacity to have two components

* memory: keep track of things
* judgement: prioritize options

Memory is easy to quantify, and can be facilitated by bookkeeping tools.
On the other hand, judgement is hard to develop, it is even hard to justify due to the lack of information.
Currently my strategy is to learn the principles in ancient teachings,
and downplay detailed calculations.

Recently I came across a lecture delivered by [Richard Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) (1915 - 1998) in 1995 called "You and Your Research" (it could also be named "You and Your career").
Dr. Hamming had major contribution to [coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory), and lived a very interesting life.
Like many other thinkers who lived long interesting lives, he has many interesting things to say.
