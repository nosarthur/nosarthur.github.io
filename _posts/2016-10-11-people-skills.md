I have been horrible in human interactions.
Thus I bought this famous book to learn the nuts and bolts.

This book was first published in 1936 and is still being actively sold today. 
According to the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People), it may be one of the most sold books in American history.
It also ranks number 38 in the [TIME magazine's all TIME 100 best non-fiction books since 1923](http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/12719.Time_Magazine_s_All_TIME_100_Best_Non_Fiction_Books).

The book is well structured and the topics are listed below.
The author gives many examples to demonstrate how each principle can be applied.
In my understanding, all his principles can be summarized in one sentence: *make the other person (instead of yourself) feel important*.

It is also interesting to check how his principles corresponds to the six principles
in the book [*Influence: the psychology of persuasion by Robert B. Cialdini*]({% post_url 2016-07-31-influence %}).

    2. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct
    2. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest
