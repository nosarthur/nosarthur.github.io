Before reading this book, my understanding of personal finance is almost null. All I know can be summarized as: *bank balances should exceed credit card debts*.
This principle does not give me any financial freedom.

This book is mind-blowing (given my limited prior knowledge) and I highly recommend it (if you are like me).
In short, the author talks about the *psychological* and *mathematical* aspects of **retiring young**.

There are a lot of information in this book and I will only briefly touch a few points in this post.

Firstly, the author considers three road maps of getting rich, which he calls

* the sidewalk
* the slowlane
* the fastlane

The sidewalker lives from paycheck to paycheck and hopes some 
event suddenly brings wealth, the slowlaner relies on a stable job 
and investments aiming retirement at age 65, and the fastlaner
builds a business system which creates passive income.

The author also provides detailed portraits of the mindposts of people on
these three road maps. Comparing to these portraits, I was probably half
way between sidewalker and slowlaner.

Secondly, the author points out that wealth is not about the amount of money one has.

> Wealth is the ability to fully experience life. --- Henry David Thoreau

His definition of wealth consists of three parts:

* Family (relationships)
* Fitness (health)
* Freedom (choice)

I find it to be a nice definition. If a good paycheck requires one to work
overtime a lot, sacrifice health and family, is it really worth it?

Then the author moves on to describe business models that could be a fastlane, which is the major part of the book.
There are really a lot of information on this.
For example, he provides calculations
about the expected income based on the desired life style at retirement.

He defines the so-called five fastlane commandments (NECST)

* Need: is there a need?
* Entry: is it hard to copy? 
* Control: do you have full control?
* Scale: does it scale?
* Time: is it passive?

He points out five business models that generate passive income

* rental systems
* computer systems
* content systems
* distribution systems
* human-resource systems

He also talks about topics such as
decision making, time management, education, risks, the three Interstates, customer service, etc.

Overall I enjoyed the reading and got myself educated in how to reach 
financial freedom. There is one point I would like to add. 
Obviously, the author is an advocate of retiring early as a millionaire 
running successful businesses. It may be inspiring to see couples with
more conventional jobs who also manage to retire early.
