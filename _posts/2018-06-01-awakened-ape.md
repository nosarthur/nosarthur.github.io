I downloaded this book from my Kindle Unlimited membership, thinking that it was about paleo diet.
Soon it became a mixture of philosophy, anthropology, scientific research on happiness, and finally Buddhism.
The author pulls together these wildly different contents nicely.
e topics

* What is [hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) and why it makes sense.
* The life styles of tribe people in Amazon and Africa, and their secret of health and happiness.
* Scientific evidences that monks are outliers in terms of happiness.
* What makes a good [shaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism).
* How to meditate and how it differs from using drugs.
* The author's interpretation of Buddhism teachings in modern society.

The author advocates paleolithic lifestyle with Buddhist meditation.
In fact, it ranks number 2 or 3 in Amazon's book category of [Theravada Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada).
