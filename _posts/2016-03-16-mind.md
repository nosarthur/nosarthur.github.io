## preface

* The object of my work has been to learn about thought, the central problem of psychology - but also, not less important, to learn how to think clearly about thought, which is philosophy.

## chapter 1. Mind as a biological problem

* Broadly speaking, the mind is that which controls behavior (the larger aspects of man's behavior, that is, excluding the purely reflexive and not worrying at this point about the question of mind in other higher animals). And broadly speaking, there are two ideas about this something that controls: one that it it spiritual or immaterial, the other that it is a physical activity of the brain.

* This is dualism, the idea that there are two totally different kinds of existence, mind and matter, and it is - for the present at least - a stumbling block for the scientific approach to understanding man.

* The alternative is monism, the idea that mind and matter are not fundamentally different but different forms of the same thing: in practice in psychology, the idea that mental processes are brain processes.

* My general position can be put precisely: Mind is the capacity for thought (thus one still has a mind when one is unconscious on the operating table, or in deep sleep): consciousness, a variable state, is a present activity of thought processes in some form; and thought itself is an activity of the brain.

* It (pain) refers both to a distinctive sensation and to a resulting emotional state that tends to produce strong avoidance.

* One of the first things the neophyte researcher must learn is to cut his coat to suit his cloth, to put on his pants one leg at a time (Ivan Petrovich Pavlov's advice!), not bite off bigger pieces than he can chew: in other words, not to pick the most important problem for research but the most important problem for which the tools are available and a method he can handle, with the expectation that when the first step has been taken he will be better able to see how to take the next.

* It should be observed that accepting biological theory as a working hypothesis commits one to no belief. The theory may even be accepted with the ultimate purpose of showing its inadequacy, thus supporting the alternative animistic theory of an immaterial mind or soul.


## chapter 2. Self-knowledge and the self
