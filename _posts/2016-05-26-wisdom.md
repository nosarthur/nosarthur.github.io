* Above all, an attempt has been made, wherever this seemed feasible, to translate philosophic ideas, normally expressed only in words, into diagrams that convey the same information by way of geometrical metaphor.

* Secondly, the current trend towards more and fiercer specialisms is making men forget their intellectual debts to their forbears.

* As one comes into the border regions and beyond, one passes from science into the field of speculation.

* In itself philosophy sets out neither to solve our troubles nor to save our souls. It is, as the Greeks put it, a kind of sightseeing adventure undertaken for its own sake.

* In studying this difficult subject we learn what others at other times have thought about these matters. And so we come to understand them better, for their way of tackling philosophy is an important facet of their way of life. In the end this may show us how to live though knowing little.

* The Orphic doctrine tends towards asceticism and emphasises mental ecstasy. By this it is hoped to achieve a state of 'enthusiasm' or union with the god, and thus to gain mystical knowledge not to be had otherwise. In this refined form, Orphic religion had a profound effect on Greek philosophy. 

* It is worth remembering that the Greek word theory first meant something like 'sight-seeing'.

* In the end it is this twofold aspect of the Greek character which enabled it, once and for all, to transform the world. Nietzsche called these two elements the Apolonian and the Dionysiac.

* But serenity on its own is just as incapable as mysticism, of causing an intellectual revolution. What is needed is a passionate search for truth and beauty.

* The original matter is what Aristotle calls the material cause. Anaximander calls it the Boundless, an infinite fund of material extending in all directions. From it the world arises and into it will in the end return.

* Like Anaximander, he (Anaximenes) holds there is a basic matter, but sees this in the specific substance air. The different forms of matter we find around us arise from air through processes of condensation and rarefaction.

* In philosophy, what is important is not so much the answers that are given, bu rather the questions that are asked.

* The Olympian cult was very much a national affair without a strict religious dogma. Orphicism, on the other hand, possessed sacred texts and held its followers together by the bonds of shared belief.

* Just as there are three kinds of men who come to attend the Olympic games, so there are three kinds of men in society. At the lowest level, there are those who come to buy and sell: next we have those who take part in the contest, and finally we have the spectators who come to see, the theoreticians in the literal sense. These last correspond to the philosophers. The philosophic way of life is the only one which holds out some hope for transcending the fortuities of existence, it provides an escape from the wheel of birth. For, according to the Pythagoreans, the soul is subject to a sequence of transmigrations.

* The Latin word 'calculation' means 'a handling of pebbles'.
