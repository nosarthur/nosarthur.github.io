* Above all, an attempt has been made, wherever this seemed feasible, to translate philosophic ideas, normally expressed only in words, into diagrams that convey the same information by way of geometrical metaphor.

* Secondly, the current trend towards more and fiercer specialisms is making men forget their intellectual debts to their forbears.

* As one comes into the border regions and beyond, one passes from science into the field of speculation.

* In itself philosophy sets out neither to solve our troubles nor to save our souls. It is, as the Greeks put it, a kind of sightseeing adventure undertaken for its own sake.

* In studying this difficult subject we learn what others at other times have thought about these matters. And so we come to understand them better, for their way of tackling philosophy is an important facet of their way of life. In the end this may show us how to live though knowing little.

* The Orphic doctrine tends towards asceticism and emphasises mental ecstasy. By this it is hoped to achieve a state of 'enthusiasm' or union with the god, and thus to gain mystical knowledge not to be had otherwise. In this refined form, Orphic religion had a profound effect on Greek philosophy. 

* In the end it is this twofold aspect of the Greek character which enabled it, once and for all, to transform the world. Nietzsche called these two elements the Apolonian and the Dionysiac.

* But serenity on its own is just as incapable as mysticism, of causing an intellectual revolution. What is needed is a passionate search for truth and beauty.
