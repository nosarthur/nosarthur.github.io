Recently, I hit into an interesting issue with python multiple inheritance.
Initially, I have a linear inheritance hierarchy `A -> B -> C`


```python
class A(object):
    def f(self):
        print('A')

class B(A):
    def f(self):
        super().f()
        print('B')

class C(B):
    pass
```

Execution of `C().f()` gives `A B` (line break is ignored).

This works well but what if we have multiple equivalent classes of `A`,
and each of them needs a corresponding `C` class?
For example,

```python
class A1(object):
    def f(self):
        print('A1')

class A2(object):
    def f(self):
        print('A2')
```
Execution of `C1().f()` should give `A1 B`, and execution of `C2().f()` should give `A2 B`.

One straightforward implementation is to apply the linear inheritance multiple times, i.e.,

```
A1 -> B1 -> C1
A2 -> B2 -> C2
```
where `B1` and `B2` have basically the same code, only differing in their base class.

This is obviously not a good design since the logic of `B` is not reused.
A better solution is to use multiple inheritance, i.e.,

```
class C1(B0, A1):
    pass
    
class C2(B0, A2):
    pass
```
where `B0` implements `B`'s functionality and is to be defined later.
The class hierarchy looks like this

<svg width='230' height='92'>
  <defs>
      <marker id="arrow" viewBox="0 -5 10 10" markerWidth="4" markerHeight="4" refx="5" refy="0" orient="auto" markerUnits="strokeWidth">
      <path d="M0,-5 L10,0 L0,5" />
      </marker>
  </defs>
    <text x='10' y='13' text-anchor='middle' font-size='15'> A1 </text>
    <line x1="15" y1="26" x2="60" y2="60" stroke="#000" stroke-width="3" marker-end="url(#arrow)" />
    <text x='115' y='13' text-anchor='middle' font-size='15'> B0 </text>
    <line x1="115" y1="26" x2="80" y2="60" stroke="#000" stroke-width="3" marker-end="url(#arrow)" />
    <line x1="120" y1="26" x2="160" y2="60" stroke="#000" stroke-width="3" marker-end="url(#arrow)" />
    <text x='215' y='13' text-anchor='middle' font-size='15'> A2 </text>
    <line x1="215" y1="26" x2="180" y2="60" stroke="#000" stroke-width="3" marker-end="url(#arrow)" />]
    <text x='70' y='82' text-anchor='middle' font-size='15'> C1 </text>
    <text x='170' y='82' text-anchor='middle' font-size='15'> C2 </text>
</svg>

And the `B0` is as follows
```
class B0(object):
    def f(self):
        super().f()
        print('B')
```
Execution of `C1.f()` indeed gives the desired result `A1 B`.

Although it works, note that `B0` does not inherit directly from any of the `A`s.
It only knows about the `A`s via the `C`s!
One natural question is then

* How does `B0.f()` access the corresponding `f()` of the `A`s?

The core of this question is **the order of function override in a complicated inheritance hierarchy**,
commonly known as Method Resolution Order (MRO).

According to [python 3.6 doc](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#super), `super`

> Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The search order is same as that used by getattr() except that the type itself is skipped.

> The __mro__ attribute of the type lists the method resolution search order used by both getattr() and super(). The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated.

In our case, `C1.mro()` or `C1.__mro__` is given by

```
[<class '__main__.C1'>, <class '__main__.B0'>, <class '__main__.A1'>, <class 'object'>]
```

Thus `super().f()` from `B0.f()` correctly finds the desired function `A1.f()`.

There is a very nice document on the python MRO written by [Dr. Michele Simionato](http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/) with many examples.

* [The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/)

One final thing to note is that new style classes (the ones inherit from `object`) and classic classes use different MRO

* new style classes MRO: [C3 linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization)
* classic classes MRO: depth first and then left to right
