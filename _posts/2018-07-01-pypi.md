[The Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) is the official repository for python packages.
It is the magic behind `pip install <your-awesome-package>`.
Recently I published a package there (see [its PyPI page here](https://pypi.org/project/gita/))
and I will share the procedures in this post.

## prerequisites

Before uploading a project to PyPI, we need to

* create user account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/)
* prepare packages and distribution information for your project

The account registration is straightforward.
For packaging and distribution, we need the following tools

```bash
pip3 install twine setuptools wheel
```

All meta data for the package should be in a python file called `setup.py`.
You can see [my setup.py example here](https://github.com/nosarthur/gita/blob/master/setup.py).
When ready, run

```bash
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

It will create a folder called `dist` with the source tarball file and wheel file in it.

## upload to PyPI

Uploading to PyPI is simply one command

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

If no error occurs, you should be able to see the release at
`https://pypi.org/project/<your-package-name>/`.
And the package is installable from any machines equipped with `pip`.

Note that PyPI does not allow overwriting an existing release.
Thus the version in `setup.py` needs to be bumped up for each upload.

To save the typying of user login for the upload, we can create a runtime
configuration file `~/.pypirc`

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
username: yourusername
```
You can also put your password there as `password: yourpassword` and limit the
file's permission

```bash
chmod 400 ~/.pypirc
```

## using README.md as PyPI project description

[Since Apr 2018, GitHub style markdown file can be used directly as PyPI project
description page](http://blog.jonparrott.com/github-flavored-markdown-on-pypi/).
All one needs to do is to set the `long_description` in `setup.py`, as follows

```python
long_description = None
with open('README.md') as f:
    long_description = f.read()

setup(
    ...
    long_description=long_description,
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
    ...
)
```
