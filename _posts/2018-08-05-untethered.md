This book is an exploration of 'self' using one's direct experience.
It is written with clarity and ranks high in several categories on Amazon

The author used Yoga and Buddhism teachings as the main framework for the book,
and added materials from Taoism and Christianity towards the end.
I highly recommend this book if the question of 'who am I' is of interest to you.

> The self is not only the center but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious, it is the center of this totality, just as the Ego is the center of the conscious mind.  --- Carl Jung (1875 - 1961)
