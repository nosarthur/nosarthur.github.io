## preprocessing

In this dataset, there are 1678 unique sentences, 178 unique
words and 118 unique root words. 

The corpus is then used to form dictionary words and 
context words. 
The context words are basically raw features. 
They could either be description of a specific feature, as the 
ones listed in Table 1, or referring to an organ.

feature | context words
---------|----------
left-right | left, right, bilateral 
--- | ----
front-back | anterior, posterior 
--- | ---
up-down | apex, base
--- | ---
distribution | patchy, focal, streaky, diffuse, scattered 
--- | ---
shape | round, irregular 
--- | ---
stage | acute, chronic
--- | ---
size | small, large
---- | ---
visibility | prominent, obscured 
--- | --- 
severity | mild, severe, moderate, borderline

> Table 1. Context words that describe a specific feature.

The dictionary words are the ones that requires embedding. 
We use the root words as dictionary words. 

There are 23 words that only appeared once, and 12 words that only appear twice. They are then removed.

## the full dataset 

The full data set is shown as follows.
The 'root' node is only for display purposes.
All words in blue boxes except 'root' are the root words
in MeSH sentences.
The qualifiers are in orange boxes.
A blank orange box means that the root word can be used alone.
