[Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_susceptibility_mapping) is a novel imaging 
technique in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) developed near 2008.
It enables the depiction of tissue's magnetic property 
and has found many 
clinical applications such as detecting micro-bleed, lesions, 
calcification, etc.
In principle, it has potential utility in any diseases with
metabolic abnormality in magnetic elements, e.g., iron, calcium, magnesium.

In this post, I will summarize the math behind it.

## signal equation with Lorentz sphere correction

In the case of magnetostatics without current source, 
the Gauss's Law and Ampere's Law are given by

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} =& 0 \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} =& 0. 
\end{align}
$$

Note here both $$\mathbf H$$ and $$\mathbf B$$ are macroscopic 
and they are related by
\begin{align}
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{B}/\mu_0-\mathbf{M} 
\end{align}
where $$\mu_0$$ is the magnetic permeability of vacuum and 
$$\mathbf M$$ is the macroscopic magnetization or magnetic
moment density.
In this note we use bold font to represent vector and 
unbold font to represent the z-component only.

For isotropic diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances, 
a linear constitutive relationship between $$\mathbf H$$
and $$\mathbf B$$ holds
\begin{align}
\mathbf{B} = \mu\mathbf{H} 
\end{align}
where $$\mu$$ is the substance permeability.
By writing $$\mu=(1+\chi)\mu_0$$, where $$\chi$$ is the 
magnetic susceptibility, we get $$\mathbf{M}=\chi\mathbf{H}$$.

With the Lorentz sphere correction, the measured NMR signal is given by
\begin{align}
\mathbf{B_\text{NMR}}=\mathbf{B}-\frac{2\mu_0}{3}\mathbf{M}
    =\left(1+\frac{\chi}{3}\right)\mu_0 \mathbf{H}.
\end{align}

Taking the curl of Ampere's law, we get
\begin{align}
\boxed{
\nabla^2\mathbf{B}_\text{NMR} = \frac{\mu_0}{3}\nabla^2\mathbf{M}
        -\mu_0\nabla\left(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{M}\right),}
\end{align}
where $$\nabla^2=\nabla\cdot\nabla$$ denotes the Laplace operator.

Since $$\chi \le1$$, we have the following approximation

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{M} = & \frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\chi}{1+\chi} 
        \left(\mathbf{B_0} + \delta \mathbf{B}\right) \\
        \simeq  & \frac{\chi}{\mu_0}\mathbf{B_0}
\end{align}
$$

Here we have used the fact that $$\delta B\ll B_0$$.

## scalar susceptibility

Assuming scalar susceptibility, the signal equation can be simplified into
\begin{align}
\boxed{
\nabla^2 f_T= \left(\frac{\nabla^2}{3}-\partial_z^2\right)\chi
\equiv \Box \chi,}  
\end{align}
where $$f_T= (B_\text{NMR}-B_0)/B_0$$ is the relative difference
field (RDF).

If $$\chi$$ is known, the relative field deviation 
$$f_T$$ is given by
\begin{align}
f_T = -\frac{1}{4\pi} \int 
    \frac{\Box \chi}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|} d\mathbf{r'}
\end{align}
since the Green's function of the Laplacian operator 
over the full space is $$1/r$$, i.e.,
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \frac{1}{r} =  -4\pi \delta(\mathbf r).
\end{align}

Using integration by parts, we get
\begin{align}
f_T(\mathbf r) = \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}
    \int_{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|>\epsilon} d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'})
    \chi(\mathbf{r'})d\mathbf {r'}\equiv d*\chi.
\end{align}
where $$*$$ denotes convolution and 
the dipole field along z direction is 
\begin{align}
d(\mathbf r) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{3\cos^2\theta -1}{r^3}.
\end{align}
Note $$d(0)$$ needs to be excluded.

So far the equations are all written in $$\mathbb R^3$$, in reality, 
$$f_T$$ is only known in a localized region $$\Omega$$.
Thus the measured $$f_T$$ can be separated into two parts, 
$$f_B$$ caused by sources $$\chi_B$$ outside $$\Omega$$ and $$f_L$$ 
caused by sources $$\chi_L$$ inside $$\Omega$$, i.e.,
\begin{align}
f_T(\mathbf r) = f_B(\mathbf r) + f_L(\mathbf r), 
\mathbf r \in \Omega
\end{align}
and $$f_L = d* \chi_L$$ and $$f_B = d*\chi_B$$
where $$\chi_B$$ is defined on $$\bar\Omega$$ and $$\chi_L$$ is defined on 
$$\Omega$$.

Since $$\nabla^2 d = 0$$ on $$\mathbb{R}^3\backslash\{0\}$$ and $$f_B$$ , we have 
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 f_B = 0.
\end{align}
If the boundary condition of $$f_B$$ is known on $$\partial\Omega$$, one can 
either solve the boundary value problem of the Laplace's equation
or match boundary values with $$f_B=d*\chi_B$$ to remove 
background field.

## inverse problem: regularization

The QSM problem is to solve $$\chi$$ given $$f_T$$ according to 
the signal equation. 
The difficulty of this inverse problem is two folds. 
Firstly, the boundary values of $$\chi$$ are not available.
Secondly, the differential operator $$\Box$$ has a non-trivial null space.

In practice, regularized minimization is used to solve this inverse problem
\begin{align}
\min_{\chi} \|f_L-d*\chi\| + \lambda |reg|.
\end{align}

In morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI), the minimization problem is
\begin{align}
\min_{\chi} \|f_L-d*\chi\|_2 + \lambda |\nabla \chi/\nabla I|_1.
\end{align}
Here the regularization term enforces the insight that a boundary is
unlikely to exist in the susceptibility map if there is no boundary at the 
at location in the reference intensity image.
$$1/\nabla I$$ is implemented as a binary mask. 

## inverse problem: solving PDE

The QSM signal equation takes the form of 2D wave equation with source if the
z direction is treated as time.
It can be solved directly if intial-boundary conditions are available. 
In practice, one can make judicious guess based on prior informations or 
simply use homogeneous initial-boundary conditions. 
On the other hand, $$f_T$$ is derived from experimental measurements thus
the source term contains error due to noise.
It is then important to study the error induced by the errors in the
source term as well as errors in the initial-boundary conditions.

The error $$\epsilon(x,t)$$ satisfies the following equation

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{cases}
\left(\partial_t^2+D\right)\epsilon(x,t) = \epsilon_f(x,t) \\
\epsilon(x,0) = \epsilon_1(x) \\
\epsilon'(x,0) = \epsilon_2(x) 
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

where $$D$$ is a spatial differential operator, $$\epsilon_{1,2}(x)$$
denote the error in the initial-boundary conditions.
For simplicity, we assume the error in the source term $$\epsilon_f$$ 
takes the following form
\begin{align}
\epsilon_f(x,t) = \sum_k A_k \delta(x-x_k)\delta(t-t_k).
\end{align}

To solve it, we utilize the spectral decomposition of $$D$$
\begin{align}
D v_i(x) = \lambda_i v_i(x).
\end{align}
Here $$v_i(x)$$ form a set of spatially orthonormal basis functions.
It is easy to show that 
\begin{align}
\epsilon(x,t) = \sum_iv_i(x)\left[\epsilon_{1i}\cos\sqrt{\lambda_i}t
    +\frac{\epsilon_{2i}}{\sqrt{\lambda_i}}\sin\sqrt{\lambda_i}t 
    + \epsilon_{3i}(t) \right],
\end{align}
where $$\epsilon_{1i}\equiv\left<v_i,\epsilon_1\right>$$ is the projection
of $$\epsilon_1(x)$$ on the $$i$$'th basis. $$\epsilon_{2i}$$ is defined 
accordingly. $$\epsilon_{3i}$$ has the form
\begin{align}
\epsilon_{3i} = \sum_k\frac{v_i(x_k)}{\sqrt{\lambda_i}}
        \sin\sqrt{\lambda_i}(t-t_k)\theta(t-t_k),
\end{align}
where $$\theta(t)$$ is the unit step function.

## generalized Lorentz correction for white matter regions

In white matter regions, the Lorentz sphere correction does not hold and
we use a different model
\begin{align}
f = d*\chi + \ell \chi,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
\ell = \left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{\sin^2\theta}{2}\right)M_\text{WM}
\end{align}
is a diagonal matrix
and $$\theta$$ is the angle between 
$$B_0$$ direction and the fiber direction.
The white matter mask $$M_\text{WM}$$ can be generated by thresholding the 
FA map.

The energy function takes the form $$\|w(Q\chi-f)\|^2$$. Here $$w$$ is a
weighting function, 
$$Q\equiv F^{-1}DF+\ell$$ with $$F$$ is the Fourier transform matrix, 
and $$D\equiv Fd$$ is the dipole function in Fourier space.
It gives rise to the linear equation
\begin{align}
Qw^2Q\chi = Qw^2f.
\end{align}
