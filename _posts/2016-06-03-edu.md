## The Individual versus the Citizen

* Assuming that education should do something to afford a training 
and not merely to prevent impediments to growth, the question
arises whether education should train good individuals or good citizens.

* First and foremost, the individual, like Leibniz's monads, should mirror the world. 

* Knowledge, emotion, and power, all these should be widened to the utmost in seeking the perfection of the human being. Power, Wisdom, and Love, according to traditional theology, are the respective attributes of the Three Persons of the Trinity, and in this respect at any rate man made God in his own image. 

* The elements of knowledge and emotion in the perfect individual as we have been portraying him are not essentially social. 
It is only through the will and through the exercise of power that the individual whom we have been imagining becomes an effective member of the community.

* The individual as such is self-subsistent, while the citizen is 
essentially circumscribed by his neighbours. 

* The fundamental characteristic of the citizen is that he co-operates, in intention if not in fact. Now the man who wishes to co-operate, unless he is one of exceptional powers, will look about for some ready-made purpose with which to co-operate. 

* Citizens as conceived by governments are persons who admire the status quo and are prepared to exert themselves for its preservation. 
Oddly enough, while all governments aim at producing men of this type to the exclusion of all other types, their heroes in the past are of exactly the sort that they aim at preventing in the present. 

* This illustrates the ways in which citizenship as an ideal is inadequate, for as an ideal it involves an absence of creativeness, and a willingness to acquiesce in the powers that be, whether oligarchic or democratic, which is contrary to what is characteristic of the greatest men, and tends, if over-emphasised, to prevent ordinary men from attaining the greatness of which they are capable. 

* Rebellion in itself is no better than acquiescence in itself, since it is equally determined by relation to what is outside ourselves rather than by a purely personal judgement of value.

* In the Middle Ages education meant the education of the priest. From the Renaissance until recent times it meant the education of a gentleman. Under the influence of snobbish democracy, it has come to mean an education which makes a man seem like a gentleman. 

* The Christian religion as a whole is a religion of the individual, owing to the fact that it arose among men destitute of political power. It is concerned primarily with the relation of the soul to God; and while it considers the relation of a man to his neighbour, it considers it as resulting from the man's own emotions, not from laws and social institutions. 

* 


## The Negative Theory of Education

* Three divergent theories of education all have their advocates
in the present day. Of these the first considers that the sole
purpose of education is to provide opportunities of growth and 
to remove hampering influences. The second holds that the purpose
of education is to give culture to the individual and to develop 
his capacities to the utmost. The third holds that education is to be 
considered rather in relation to the community than in relation to 
the individual, and that its business is to train useful citizens.
Of these theories the first is the newest while the third is the 
oldest.
