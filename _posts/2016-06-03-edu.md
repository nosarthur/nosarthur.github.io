## The Individual versus the Citizen

* Assuming that education should do something to afford a training 
and not merely to prevent impediments to growth, the question
arises whether education should train good individuals or good citizens.

## The Negative Theory of Education

* Three divergent theories of education all have their advocates
in the present day. Of these the first considers that the sole
purpose of education is to provide opportunities of growth and 
to remove hampering influences. The second holds that the purpose
of education is to give culture to the individual and to develop 
his capacities to the utmost. The third holds that education is to be 
considered rather in relation to the community than in relation to 
the individual, and that its business is to train useful citizens.
Of these theories the first is the newest while the third is the 
oldest.
