[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) is a rich and thoughtful novella about geometry, sociology, politics, and religion.
The author [Edwin Abbott Abbott (1838-1926, aged 87)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Abbott_Abbott) was a British educator and theologian.

The book takes the form of a memoir written by a square living in a fictional 2D world called Flatland.
There are three major themes

* The social hierarchy of the citizens (i.e., 2D shapes) in Flatland.
* A historical movement in Flatland of using technology (color) to overthrow aristocracy and establish equality among all 2D shapes, and how it ended.
* The square's 'religious' experience with a sphere from the 3D world Spaceland, and what happens to an apostle to spread the gospel of The Third Dimension.

This is a fun book to read and I highly recommend it.
It is currently in the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain)
(first published in 1884) so there are many free versions available.
For example, I read the free Kindle AmazonClassics Edition (which lacks the illustrations).
