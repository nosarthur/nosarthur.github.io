This is a person's life from summer 1966 to autumn 1980.
The author, [Nien Cheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nien_Cheng) (aged 94),
held very high position in [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell)'s
Shanghai office before its exit from China in 1966.
She was then locked up in detention house for more than 6 years due to the
political turmoils and eventually left China in 1980.

Her experience is shocking and I read it in awe,
for her courage, faith, benevolence, and wisdom.
