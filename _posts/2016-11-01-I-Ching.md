[I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) is an important Chinese classic. 
Together with the [five elements theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing), I Ching provides a foundation to Chinese philosophy, geomancy, 
medical theory and mysticism.
Legend says the emperor [Fuxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi) created
the [trigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua) and the [King Wen of Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou) (~1000 BC) created the hexagrams.
The title of the book literally means 'canon of change' and the book has 
traditionally been used for divination.

The author [Kerson Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerson_Huang) is a 
famous Chinese American physicist.
He passed away this year at the age of 88.
The other author is his wife.
I am not familiar with his research (particle physics) and I knew the author
from his book on statistical mechanics.

There is a revised edition published in 2014, which I haven't read.

Dr. Huang's book includes the history of I Ching, its traditional oracles
methods (tortoise shell and yarrow) and modern day methods (coins and computer),
and detailed descriptions of the 64 hexagrams. He has a scientific 
perspective on I Ching and there is nothing supernatural in his book.
