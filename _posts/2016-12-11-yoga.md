I took my first yoga class on 2/7/2013.
Initially the intention was merely to supplement my martial art training with some stretches.
Soon I realized that yoga is a lot more than that.
It is a practice of

* flexibility
* strength
* body control

As I progress, other benefits start to merge. The major ones are

* correcting body postures
* increasing breathing capacity
* overcoming fear

First of all, yoga poses provide tests for the asymmetries and one can strengthen the weak side accordingly.
As a result of bad body postures, asymmetries develop in the body.
Take myself for example, it's easier to twist my torso to the left than to the right.
Also, it's easier to bend forward than bend backward.
I suppose these asymmetries are not good as one grows older. 

The modern office life forces us to sit long hours everyday, and the body easily fall into a shrimp like shape.
All the twisting yoga poses help straighten the spine and open the chest. It's like a chiropractice performed by oneself.

Secondly, yoga helps to release muscle tension.
Tight muscles tend to snap just like tight cords.
I suspect that muscle tensions are emotion-aroused and are related to the [fight-or-flight response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response).
For example, it may be hard to breath when anxious.
Also the muscles in the back and neck may tighten when one gets angry.

For some reason we don't have conscious control over many muscle groups.
Even if you don't feel the existence of muscle tensions,
you may find your flexibility increase dramatically by doing yoga,
especially in the chest and hip regions.
For example, you probably have seen pictures of yogis sitting in [lotus position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_position) or doing some intense back bends.
These flexibilities are beneficial.
With a relaxed and open chest, the breathing capacity increases and one feels more energetic.

I also think everyone has the capacity to be flexible.
The author of the following book says that one should be able to do side split as long as he/she can raise each leg parallel to the floor while the other is vertical,
since there is no muscle or tendon running from left leg to right leg.

In reality very few of us can do side split, due to lack of strength and/or fear.
You may also notice that infants and young kids are incredibly flexible.
I suspect that we gradually lose our flexibility over the years by building up unnecessary muscle tensions due to repressed emotions.
I also suspect that when repressed emotion is let go, one regains the corresponding flexibility.

This brings to my third point, which is more psychological.
Many yoga poses trigger fear, e.g., back bends and inversions.
I think the fear partly originates from revisiting the repressed past and partly originates from lack of oxygen.
These two aspects could also be the two sides of the same coin.
By holding an uneasy pose for prolonged time, the body gradually adapts and eventually releases the tension.
These moments are very distinct, like the ice on the lake starts to break in the early spring.

Finally, I would like to emphasize the importance of a good teacher. 
Without proper guidance, it can be harmful to do yoga.
Particularly, one should not rush to the advanced poses before the basics are solid.
