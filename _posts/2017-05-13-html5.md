Due to the positive experience with the "Head first design pattern" book (see [my review here]({% post_url 2017-04-02-head-first-design %})), I bought this one by the same authors.
Again, it's fun to read and also quite informative. I read it while commuting between home and office, and it took about two weeks to finish (573 pages).

I have used javascript a little bit in the past just for fun (see the following two side projects), and also a little bit in my current job. But 
I don't really understand how it works previously. This book definitely helps to fill some gaps.

* [a project using D3.js](http://nos.pythonanywhere.com/)
* [a project using polymer.js](https://todoslacker.herokuapp.com/)

Here is a brief summary of what I have learned from it:

* Document object model (DOM)
    * object that connects HTML and javascript
    * tree like strucutre that represents elements in the HTML markup
    * `document.createElement()`
    * `document.getElementById()`
    * `document.getElementsByTagName()`
    * `document.getElementsByClassName()`
    * `document.querySelector()`
    * `document.querySelectorAll()`
* event handlers   
    * `window.onload`
    * `button.onclick`
* geolocation: 
    * `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`
    * `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition()`
* web request
    * `XMLHttpRequest`: same server
        * `var request = new XMLHttpRequest();`
        * `request.onload = function(){ ... };`
        * `request.open("GET", url);`
        * `request.send(null);`
    * JSONP: access remote server `<script src="http://.../...?callback=..."></script>`
* canvas
    * `var context = canvas.getContext("2d");`
    * `context.beginPath();`
    * `context.arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, direction)`
    * `context.fillStyle = "lightblue";`
    * `context.fill();`
* video
    * `<video controls autoplay src="..." width="480" height="360" poster="..." id="video"></video>`
    * `<source src="...mp4">`
    * scratch buffer with the help of canvas
        * `getImageData()`
        * `putImageData()`
* web storage
    * cookies: 4k, server side
    * localStorage: > 5M, client side, persists
    * sessionStorage: > 5M, client side, doesn't persist
    * `localStorage.getItem()`
    * `localStorage.setItem()`
    * `localStorage.removeItem()`
    * `localStorage.clear()`
    * `localStorage.key()`
* web worker: multi-threads
    * `var worker = new Worker("....js");` 
    * `worker.postMessage("ping");`
    * `worker.onmessage = function (event) { ... }`
    * `worker.terminate()`
    * `worker.onerror = function(error){ ... }`
    * `importScripts()`
* top appendix topics
    * Modernizr
    * audio
    * JQuery
    * SVG 
    * offline web apps
    * web sockets
