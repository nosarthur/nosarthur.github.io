Recently I started to look into how the tax works since I have more money to worry about after joining industry.
In this post I will explain some basics on saving money on tax.
Home and stocks related issues are not included since I don't own them.
As for tax filing, [turbo tax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/) can be used for both state and federal tax returns. Its free service is sufficient for me and it even includes electronic filing.

## tax brackets

The [tax brackets](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx) determines the rate at which tax is collected. 
For example, the 2017 (for filing in 2018 Apr) tax brackets are as follows.

 Tax rate  |  Married filing jointly | Single
 ---- | ----
 10% |  Up to $18,650 | Up to $9,325
 15% |  $18,651 to $75,900  | $9,326 to $37,950
 25% |  $75,901 to $153,100 | $37,951 to $91,900
 28% |  $153,101 to $233,350  | $91,901 to $191,650
 33% |  $233,351 to $416,700  | $191,651 to $416,700
 35% |  $416,701 to $470,700  | $416,701 to $418,400
 39.6% | $470,701 or more |  $418,401 or more

Note that the tax rate is progressive.
For example, if a single person's taxable income is 100k, the first $9,325 is taxed at 10% rate, the next $37,950-$9,326=$28,624 is taxed at 15%, etc.
This design ensures that you won't end up with less money by earning more.

## general strategy

Since the tax rate is quite high (at least 10%), it makes sense to lower the taxable income as much as possible.
Pre-tax deductions include

* standard deduction: $12.6k married filled jointly or $6.3k single
* exemption: $4.05k per person
* traditional IRA: $5.5k max
* 401k: $18k max
* FSA: $2.6k max
* itemized deduction
    * mortgage
    * charity
    * etc

Note that standard deduction and itemized deduction are mutually exclusive, only one of them can be claimed.
Also there are limitations on the availability of IRA 

* traditional IRA: only available for individuals making under $60k or married couple $95k
* roth IRA: only available to individuals making under $132k or married couple $194k

The roth IRA is not tax deductible. The sum of traditional and roth IRA is limited to $5.5k.

There are also after-tax credits which deducts tax dollar by dollar.
Some relevant ones are as follows

* American Opportunity Tax Credit
* Lifetime Learning Credit
* Child and Dependent Care Credit
* Mortgage Tax Credit
