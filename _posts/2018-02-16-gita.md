Recently I wrote a small command-line tool called `gita` to view multiple git repos side by side.
The source code can be accessed [here on github](https://github.com/nosarthur/gita).
Its motivation is that I need to compile multiple repos against each other and it is critical to have them on the correct branches.
A screenshot is shown below

Here the color codings denote the 5 situations between local and remote branches:

* white: the local branch has no remote branch.
* green: the local branch is the same as the remote branch.
* red: the local branch has diverged from the remote branch.
* purple: the local branch is ahead of the remote branch (good for push).
* yellow: the local branch is behind the remote branch (good for merge).

The color choices of purple for ahead and yellow for behind is motivated by [blueshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift) and [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift).

And the extra status symbols have the following meaning:

* `+`: staged change exists
* `*`: unstaged change exists

This command-line tool also delegates some simple `git` command such that I don't need to go into each repo directory to perform them.

One neat python 3.6 feature I discovered working on this side project is the so-called `f-string`, introduced in [PEP-498](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/).
It enables embedding of python expressions directly into the string literal, e.g.,

```python
name = 'test-repo'
green = '\x1b[32m'
end = '\x1b[0m'
print(f'{name:<18}{green} master *+ {end}\n')
```

All you need to do is to place the expression inside braces.

Another small issue I found is that the python package `argparse` doesn't work out of box when both `nargs='*'` and `choices` are set.
For example, I would like to call

```
gita fetch
gita fetch repo1 repo2
```

where the no-argument case fetches all registered repos and the with-argument case fetches the specified repos.
The following code errors out even if `default` is set.

```python
p_fetch.add_argument('repo', nargs='*', choices=utils.get_repos())
```

The underlying problem is that the no-argument case (i.e., `repo` being empty list) is not in the choices,
 which feels like a bug to me.
I think that case should automatically bypass the `choices` check.
As a workaround, I defined another function `utils.get_choices()` to add an empty list to the choices.
