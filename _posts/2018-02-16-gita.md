Recently I wrote a small command-line tool to view multiple git repos side by side.
The repo can be accessed [here on github](https://github.com/nosarthur/gita).
Its main functionality is shown in the screenshot below

The motivation of this tool is that I need to compile multiple repos against each other and it is essential to have them on the correct branches.

One neat python 3.6 feature I discovered working on this side project is the so-called `f-string`, introduced in [PEP-498](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/).
It allows embedding of python expressions inside braces directly into the string literal, e.g.,

```python
name = 'test-repo'
green = '\x1b[32m'
end = '\x1b[0m'
print(f'{name:<18}{green} master *+ {end}\n')
```

It can go as crazy as defining and evaluating lambda functions in the same f-string.
