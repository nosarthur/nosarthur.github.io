The martial art activities that I practice somewhat consistently over the years include 

* karate
* tae kwon do
* taichi
* kendo
* Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)
* yoga

Personally, I find only yoga and BJJ newbie friendly.
The other arts are all great but the initial learning curves are too steep.
For example, although I have practiced karate for over 10 years and got brown belt from [Shotokan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan) in 2010, I still consider my basics wrong.

The body control is hard enough even for static poses but most martial arts require not only moving but also rapid engagement and relaxation of specific muscle groups. Rushing oneself usually ends up with bad postures,
unnecessary muscle tensions, and eventually injuries.

In China, there is a saying that as one's martial art training deepens,
his spiritual practice should deepen accordingly.
Otherwise the ego takes over and it damages both the martial art practitioner and also people around him.
It is also common that the top martial artists develops interesting philosophical ideas.
The most famous one nowadays may be [Bruce Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee)

The ancient Japanese sword master [Miyamoto Musashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi) also wrote a very nice book on swordsmanship: the book of five rings. The five chapters are earth, water, fire, wind, and emptiness.

There are interesting stories of ancient Chinese and Japanese masters on the interplay of skills and mind.
Many of them say similar things, such as 'one mind', 'no mind', 'oneness of the art and the mind'.
My guess is that ego prevents one to reach the best performance, be it
throwing an opponent over the shoulder, making sushi, writing a paper, 
or delivering a software.

In terms of fun, I find kendo and BJJ the best.
They are both extremely realistic and practical.
