This book covers many practical topics such as

- the conditions the baby may have, their causes, and the common treatments,
- the choices parents need to make for their babies and the pros and cons of the options.

I extracted some of the useful information below.
Make sure not to buy the Kindle version: the pages are images instead of texts, thus it cannot be zoomed or searched.
