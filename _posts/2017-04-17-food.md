In the past few months, my wife and I have been trying food subscription services. The service providers sends us (raw) materials and recipes each week which allows us to

* save time in shopping and planning
* enjoy restaurant level dishes with much lower price
* learn to cook (like a pro)

The ones we tried are as follows, and the ones we liked are in bold face

* **[Home chef](https://www.homechef.com)**
* **[Pete's paleo](https://www.petespaleo.com)**
* [Blue apron](https://www.blueapron.com/)
* [Green chef](https://greenchef.com/home)
* [Hello fresh](https://www.hellofresh.com/tasty/)
* [Martha and Marley spoon](https://marleyspoon.com/menu)

We finally settled with Home Chef.
It's probably not particularly healthy as some of the others are but it tastes really good.

Among them, Pete's paleo is a little different from the others in that the food is actually cooked. It is thus slightly more convenient (and less fun) since you just need to warm it up.
