## problem statement and notations

Following Pruessmann's SENSE paper, the geometry factor for voxel 
$$i$$ in the reconstructed image is defined as


$$
g_i = \sqrt{[(S^H\Psi^{-1}S)^{-1}]_{ii}(S^H\Psi^{-1}S)_{ii}}
$$

where $$S$$ is the sensitivity matrix, and $$\Psi$$ is the noise correlation matrix.

To simplify the notation, let's define
\begin{align}
A = S^H\Psi^{-1}S
\end{align}
From the definition, it is obvious that $$A$$ is Hermitian. Furthermore, 
since the noise correlation matrix $$\Psi$$ is a positive definite matrix, $$A$$ is also
positive definite.

Thus the goal is to show $$A_{ii}(A^{-1})_{ii}\ge1$$ for all $$i$$, with Hermitian positive definite matrix $$A$$.

## the proof

Hermitian positive definite matrix has the spectral decomposition
\begin{align}
A = Q^H\Lambda Q
\end{align}
where $$\Lambda$$ is the diagonal matrix with positive entries, and $$Q$$ is unitary whose columns satisfy $$q_i^Hq_j=\delta_{ij}$$.

Using this decomposition and assuming the number of coils to be $$N_c$$, we have 

$$ \begin{align}
g_i =& \sum_{j,k=1}^{N_c}|q_{ij}|^2|q_{ik}|^2\frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_k} \\
 =& \sum_{j=1}^{N_c}|q_{ij}|^4 +\sum_{j=1}^{N_c}\sum_{k>j} |q_{ij}|^2|q_{ik}|^2\left(\frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_k} +\frac{\lambda_k}{\lambda_j} \right) \notag \\
 \ge& \left( \sum_j |q_{ij}|^2 \right)^2 \\
 = & 1
\end{align} $$

Here we have used the fact that all $$\lambda_j$$ are positive to get 
\begin{align}
\frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_k} + \frac {\lambda_k}{\lambda_j}\ge 2
\end{align}
