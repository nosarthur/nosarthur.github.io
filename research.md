I have been working on a few different fields. Here is a brief summary of them.

### medical imaging

I am most familiar with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the signal comes from hydrogen atoms (thanks to the abundance of water in human body).

### quantum information / computing

The goal of this field is to build a computer with information being stored in quantum states. The reward is that certain hard computational problems on classical computers may be come much easier. The famous example is Shor's algorithm, which factors large number in polynomial time on a quantum computer. The origin of this extra computational power is not fully understood. A vague explanation goes as follows. A classical bit takes value of either 0 or 1 while a quantum bit (qubit) can be in any combination of 0 or 1. For two classical bits, there are four possible states. Whereas for two qubits, they can be in a state that is a mixture of all four possible states, say 00+01+10+11. 

### biophysics

I have some experience using synchrotron light to look at biological samples, mostly nacre (mother of pearl). The particular technique is called X-ray PhotoElectron Emission spectroMicroscopy (X-PEEM). As the name indicates, it can be used both as spectroscopy and microscopy. The spectroscopy part is commonly known as X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy.
